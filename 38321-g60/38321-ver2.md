# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations

## 3.1 Definitions

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [[1]](#2-References) and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [[1]](#2-References).

**Dormant BWP:** The dormant BWP is one of downlink BWPs configured by the network via dedicated RRC signaling. In the dormant BWP, the UE stop monitoring PDCCH on/for the SCell, but continues performing CSI measurements, Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and beam management, if configured.

**DRX group:** A group of Serving Cells that is configured by RRC and that have the same DRX Active Time.

**HARQ information:** HARQ information for DL-SCH, for UL-SCH, or for SL-SCH transmissions consists of New Data Indicator (NDI), Transport Block size (TBS), Redundancy Version (RV), and HARQ process ID.

**IAB-donor:** gNB that provides network access to UEs via a network of backhaul and access links.

**IAB-node:** RAN node that supports NR access links to UEs and NR backhaul links to parent nodes and child nodes.

**Listen Before Talk**: A procedure according to which transmissions are not performed if the channel is identified as being occupied, see TS 37.213 [[18]](#2-References).

**Msg3**: Message transmitted on UL-SCH containing a C-RNTI MAC CE or CCCH SDU, submitted from upper layer and associated with the UE Contention Resolution Identity, as part of a Random Access procedure.

**NR backhaul link:** NR link used for backhauling between an IAB-node and an IAB-donor, and between IAB-nodes in case of a multi-hop backhauling.

**NR sidelink communication**: AS functionality enabling at least V2X Communication as defined in TS 23.287 [[19]](#2-References), between two or more nearby UEs, using NR technology but not traversing any network node.

**PDCCH occasion**: A time duration (i.e. one or a consecutive number of symbols) during which the MAC entity is configured to monitor the PDCCH.

**Serving Cell:** A PCell, a PSCell, or an SCell in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References).

**Sidelink transmission information:** Sidelink transmission information included in a SCI for a SL-SCH transmission as specified in clause 8.3 and 8.4 of TS 38.212 [[9]](#2-References) consists of Sidelink HARQ information including NDI, RV, Sidelink process ID, HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator, Sidelink identification information including cast type indicator, Source Layer-1 ID and Destination Layer-1 ID, and Sidelink other information including CSI request, a priority, a communication range requirement and Zone ID.

**Special Cell:** For Dual Connectivity operation the term Special Cell refers to the PCell of the MCG or the PSCell of the SCG depending on if the MAC entity is associated to the MCG or the SCG, respectively. Otherwise the term Special Cell refers to the PCell. A Special Cell supports PUCCH transmission and contention-based Random Access, and is always activated.

**Timing Advance Group:** A group of Serving Cells that is configured by RRC and that, for the cells with a UL configured, using the same timing reference cell and the same Timing Advance value. A Timing Advance Group containing the SpCell of a MAC entity is referred to as Primary Timing Advance Group (PTAG), whereas the term Secondary Timing Advance Group (STAG) refers to other TAGs.

**V2X sidelink communication**: AS functionality enabling V2X Communication as defined in TS 23.285 [[20]](#2-References), between nearby UEs, using E-UTRA technology but not traversing any network node.

NOTE: A timer is running once it is started, until it is stopped or until it expires; otherwise it is not running. A timer can be started if it is not running or restarted if it is running. A Timer is always started or restarted from its initial value. The duration of a timer is not updated until it is stopped or expires (e.g. due to BWP switching). When the MAC entity applies zero value for a timer, the timer shall be started and immediately expire unless explicitly stated otherwise.

# 4 General

## 4.1 Introduction

The objective of this clause is to describe the MAC architecture and the MAC entity of the UE from a functional point of view.

## 4.2 MAC architecture

### 4.2.1 General

This clause describes a model of the MAC i.e. it does not specify or restrict implementations.

RRC is in control of the MAC configuration.

### 4.2.2 MAC Entities

The MAC entity of the UE handles the following transport channels:

* Broadcast Channel (BCH);

* Downlink Shared Channel(s) (DL-SCH);

* Paging Channel (PCH);

* Uplink Shared Channel(s) (UL-SCH);

* Random Access Channel(s) (RACH).

When the UE is configured with SCG, two MAC entities are configured to the UE: one for the MCG and one for the SCG.

When the UE is configured with DAPS handover, two MAC entities are used by the UE: one for the source cell (source MAC entity) and one for the target cell (target MAC entity).

The functions of the different MAC entities in the UE operate independently unless otherwise specified. The timers and parameters used in each MAC entity are configured independently unless otherwise specified. The Serving Cells, C-RNTI, radio bearers, logical channels, upper and lower layer entities, LCGs, and HARQ entities considered by each MAC entity refer to those mapped to that MAC entity unless otherwise specified.

If the MAC entity is configured with one or more SCells, there are multiple DL-SCH and there may be multiple UL-SCH as well as multiple RACH per MAC entity; one DL-SCH, one UL-SCH, and one RACH on the SpCell, one DL-SCH, zero or one UL-SCH and zero or one RACH for each SCell.

If the MAC entity is not configured with any SCell, there is one DL-SCH, one UL-SCH, and one RACH per MAC entity.

Figure 4.2.2-1 illustrates one possible structure of the MAC entity when SCG is not configured and for each MAC entity during DAPS handover.

Figure 4.2.2-2: MAC structure overview with two MAC entities

In addition, the MAC entity of the UE handles the following transport channel for sidelink:

* Sidelink Shared Channel (SL-SCH);

* Sidelink Broadcast Channel (SL-BCH).

Figure 4.2.2-3 illustrates one possible structure for the MAC entity when sidelink is configured.

# 5 MAC procedures

## 5.1 Random Access procedure

### 5.1.1 Random Access procedure initialization

The Random Access procedure described in this clause is initiated by a PDCCH order, by the MAC entity itself, or by RRC for the events in accordance with TS 38.300 [[2]](#2-References). There is only one Random Access procedure ongoing at any point in time in a MAC entity. The Random Access procedure on an SCell shall only be initiated by a PDCCH order with *ra-PreambleIndex* different from 0b000000.

NOTE 1: If a new Random Access procedure is triggered while another is already ongoing in the MAC entity, it is up to UE implementation whether to continue with the ongoing procedure or start with the new procedure (e.g. for SI request).

NOTE 2: If there was an ongoing Random Access procedure that is triggered by a PDCCH order while the UE receives another PDCCH order indicating the same Random Access Preamble, PRACH mask index and uplink carrier, the Random Access procedure is considered as the same Random Access procedure as the ongoing one and not initialized again.

The RA-RNTI is calculated as specified in clause 5.1.3.

    - 2> apply the Timing Advance Command for PTAG;

    - 2> start or restart the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with PTAG.

- 1> when a *timeAlignmentTimer* expires:

    - 2> if the *timeAlignmentTimer* is associated with the PTAG:

      - 3> flush all HARQ buffers for all Serving Cells;

      - 3> notify RRC to release PUCCH for all Serving Cells, if configured;

      - 3> notify RRC to release SRS for all Serving Cells, if configured;

      - 3> clear any configured downlink assignments and configured uplink grants;

      - 3> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting;

      - 3> consider all running *timeAlignmentTimer*s as expired;

      - 3> maintain NTA (defined in TS 38.211 [[8]](#2-References)) of all TAGs.

    - 2> else if the *timeAlignmentTimer* is associated with an STAG, then for all Serving Cells belonging to this TAG:

      - 3> flush all HARQ buffers;

      - 3> notify RRC to release PUCCH, if configured;

      - 3> notify RRC to release SRS, if configured;

      - 3> clear any configured downlink assignments and configured uplink grants;

      - 3> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting;

      - 3> maintain NTA (defined in TS 38.211 [[8]](#2-References)) of this TAG.

When the MAC entity stops uplink transmissions for an SCell due to the fact that the maximum uplink transmission timing difference between TAGs of the MAC entity or the maximum uplink transmission timing difference between TAGs of any MAC entity of the UE is exceeded, the MAC entity considers the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with the SCell as expired.

The MAC entity shall not perform any uplink transmission on a Serving Cell except the Random Access Preamble and MSGA transmission when the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with the TAG to which this Serving Cell belongs is not running. Furthermore, when the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with the PTAG is not running, the MAC entity shall not perform any uplink transmission on any Serving Cell except the Random Access Preamble and MSGA transmission on the SpCell.

## 5.3 DL-SCH data transfer

### 5.3.1 DL Assignment reception

Downlink assignments received on the PDCCH both indicate that there is a transmission on a DL-SCH for a particular MAC entity and provide the relevant HARQ information.

When the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, Temporary C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, the MAC entity shall for each PDCCH occasion during which it monitors PDCCH and for each Serving Cell:

- 1> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion and this Serving Cell has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, or Temporary CRNTI:

    - 2> if this is the first downlink assignment for this Temporary C-RNTI:

      - 3> consider the NDI to have been toggled.

    - 2> if the downlink assignment is for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, and if the previous downlink assignment indicated to the HARQ entity of the same HARQ process was either a downlink assignment received for the MAC entity's CS-RNTI or a configured downlink assignment:

      - 3> consider the NDI to have been toggled regardless of the value of the NDI.

    - 2> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment and deliver the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

- 1> else if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been received for this Serving Cell on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's CS-RNTI:

    - 2> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 1:

      - 3> consider the NDI for the corresponding HARQ process not to have been toggled;

      - 3> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment for this Serving Cell and deliver the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

    - 2> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 0:

      - 3> if PDCCH contents indicate SPS deactivation:

        - 4> clear the configured downlink assignment for this Serving Cell (if any);

        - 4> if the *timeAlignmentTimer*, associated with the TAG containing the Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is running:

          - 5> indicate a positive acknowledgement for the SPS deactivation to the physical layer.

      - 3> else if PDCCH content indicates SPS activation:

        - 4> store the downlink assignment for this Serving Cell and the associated HARQ information as configured downlink assignment;

        - 4> initialise or re-initialise the configured downlink assignment for this Serving Cell to start in the associated PDSCH duration and to recur according to rules in clause 5.8.1;

For each Serving Cell and each configured downlink assignment, if configured and activated, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the PDSCH duration of the configured downlink assignment does not overlap with the PDSCH duration of a downlink assignment received on the PDCCH for this Serving Cell:

    - 2> instruct the physical layer to receive, in this PDSCH duration, transport block on the DL-SCH according to the configured downlink assignment and to deliver it to the HARQ entity;

    - 2> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PDSCH duration;

    - 2> consider the NDI bit for the corresponding HARQ process to have been toggled;

    - 2> indicate the presence of a configured downlink assignment and deliver the stored HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

For configured downlink assignments without *harq-ProcID-Offset*, the HARQ Process ID associated with the slot where the DL transmission starts is derived from the following equation:

HARQ Process ID = [floor (CURRENT_slot × 10 / (*numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × *periodicity*))] modulo *nrofHARQ-Processes*

where CURRENT_slot = [(SFN × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame*) + slot number in the frame] and *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* refers to the number of consecutive slots per frame as specified in TS 38.211 [[8]](#2-References).

For configured downlink assignments with *harq-ProcID-Offset*, the HARQ Process ID associated with the slot where the DL transmission starts is derived from the following equation:

HARQ Process ID = [floor (CURRENT_slot × 10 / (*numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × *periodicity*))] modulo *nrofHARQ-Processes* + *harq-ProcID-Offset*

where CURRENT_slot = [(SFN × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame*) + slot number in the frame] and *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* refers to the number of consecutive slots per frame as specified in TS 38.211 [[8]](#2-References).

NOTE 1: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the HARQ Process ID used for configured downlink assignments.

NOTE 2: CURRENT_slot refers to the slot index of the first transmission occasion of a bundle of configured downlink assignment.

When the MAC entity needs to read BCCH, the MAC entity may, based on the scheduling information from RRC:

- 1> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been received on the PDCCH for the SI-RNTI;

    - 2> indicate a downlink assignment and redundancy version for the dedicated broadcast HARQ process to the HARQ entity.

### 5.3.2 HARQ operation

#### 5.3.2.1 HARQ Entity

The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell, which maintains a number of parallel HARQ processes. Each HARQ process is associated with a HARQ process identifier. The HARQ entity directs HARQ information and associated TBs received on the DL-SCH to the corresponding HARQ processes (see clause 5.3.2.2).

The number of parallel DL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References). The dedicated broadcast HARQ process is used for BCCH.

The HARQ process supports one TB when the physical layer is not configured for downlink spatial multiplexing. The HARQ process supports one or two TBs when the physical layer is configured for downlink spatial multiplexing.

When the MAC entity is configured with *pdsch-AggregationFactor* \> 1, the parameter *pdsch-AggregationFactor* provides the number of transmissions of a TB within a bundle of the downlink assignment. Bundling operation relies on the HARQ entity for invoking the same HARQ process for each transmission that is part of the same bundle. After the initial transmission, *pdsch-AggregationFactor* – 1 HARQ retransmissions follow within a bundle.

The MAC entity shall:

- 1> if a downlink assignment has been indicated:

    - 2> allocate the TB(s) received from the physical layer and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ process indicated by the associated HARQ information.

- 1> if a downlink assignment has been indicated for the broadcast HARQ process:

    - 2> allocate the received TB to the broadcast HARQ process.

#### 5.3.2.2 HARQ process

When a transmission takes place for the HARQ process, one or two (in case of downlink spatial multiplexing) TBs and the associated HARQ information are received from the HARQ entity.

For each received TB and associated HARQ information, the HARQ process shall:

- 1> if the NDI, when provided, has been toggled compared to the value of the previous received transmission corresponding to this TB; or

- 1> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process, and this is the first received transmission for the TB according to the system information schedule indicated by RRC; or

- 1> if this is the very first received transmission for this TB (i.e. there is no previous NDI for this TB):

    - 2> consider this transmission to be a new transmission.

- 1> else:

    - 2> consider this transmission to be a retransmission.

The MAC entity then shall:

- 1> if this is a new transmission:

    - 2> attempt to decode the received data.

- 1> else if this is a retransmission:

    - 2> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:

      - 3> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the data currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the combined data.

- 1> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was successfully decoded for this TB; or

- 1> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:

    - 2> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process:

      - 3> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.

    - 2> else if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this TB:

      - 3> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing entity.

- 1> else:

    - 2> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer for this TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.

- 1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a Temporary C-RNTI and the Contention Resolution is not yet successful (see clause 5.1.5); or

- 1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a MSGB-RNTI and the Random Access procedure is not yet successfully completed (see clause 5.1.4a); or

- 1> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process; or

- 1> if the *timeAlignmentTimer*, associated with the TAG containing the Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped or expired:

    - 2> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in this TB.

- 1> else:

    - 2> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in this TB.

The MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all downlink assignments on PDCCH for its Temporary C-RNTI when determining if NDI on PDCCH for its C-RNTI has been toggled compared to the value in the previous transmission.

NOTE: If the MAC entity receives a retransmission with a TB size different from the last TB size signalled for this TB, the UE behavior is left up to UE implementation.

### 5.3.3 Disassembly and demultiplexing

The MAC entity shall disassemble and demultiplex a MAC PDU as defined in clauses 6.1.2 and 6.1.5a.

## 5.4 UL-SCH data transfer

### 5.4.1 UL Grant reception

Uplink grant is either received dynamically on the PDCCH, in a Random Access Response, configured semi-persistently by RRC or determined to be associated with the PUSCH resource of MSGA as specified in clause 5.1.2a. The MAC entity shall have an uplink grant to transmit on the UL-SCH. To perform the requested transmissions, the MAC layer receives HARQ information from lower layers. An uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI = 0 is considered as a configured uplink grant. An uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI = 1 is considered as a dynamic uplink grant.

If the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, a Temporary C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, the MAC entity shall for each PDCCH occasion and for each Serving Cell belonging to a TAG that has a running *timeAlignmentTimer* and for each grant received for this PDCCH occasion:

- 1> if an uplink grant for this Serving Cell has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's C-RNTI or Temporary C-RNTI; or

- 1> if an uplink grant has been received in a Random Access Response:

    - 2> if the uplink grant is for MAC entity's C-RNTI and if the previous uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same HARQ process was either an uplink grant received for the MAC entity's CS-RNTI or a configured uplink grant:

      - 3> consider the NDI to have been toggled for the corresponding HARQ process regardless of the value of the NDI.

    - 2> if the uplink grant is for MAC entity's C-RNTI, and the identified HARQ process is configured for a configured uplink grant:

      - 3> start or restart the *configuredGrantTimer* for the corresponding HARQ process, if configured.

      - 3> stop the *cg-RetransmissionTimer* for the corresponding HARQ process, if running.

    - 2> deliver the uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

- 1> else if an uplink grant for this PDCCH occasion has been received for this Serving Cell on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's CS-RNTI:

    - 2> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 1:

      - 3> consider the NDI for the corresponding HARQ process not to have been toggled;

      - 3> start or restart the *configuredGrantTimer* for the corresponding HARQ process, if configured;

      - 3> stop the *cg-RetransmissionTimer* for the corresponding HARQ process, if running;

      - 3> deliver the uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

    - 2> else if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 0:

      - 3> if PDCCH contents indicate configured grant Type 2 deactivation:

        - 4> trigger configured uplink grant confirmation.

      - 3> else if PDCCH contents indicate configured grant Type 2 activation:

        - 4> trigger configured uplink grant confirmation;

        - 4> store the uplink grant for this Serving Cell and the associated HARQ information as configured uplink grant;

        - 4> initialise or re-initialise the configured uplink grant for this Serving Cell to start in the associated PUSCH duration and to recur according to rules in clause 5.8.2;

        - 4> stop the *configuredGrantTimer* for the corresponding HARQ process, if running;

        - 4> stop the *cg-RetransmissionTimer* for the corresponding HARQ process, if running.

For each Serving Cell and each configured uplink grant, if configured and activated, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the MAC entity is configured with *lch-basedPrioritization*, and the PUSCH duration of the configured uplink grant does not overlap with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload for this Serving Cell; or

- 1> if the MAC entity is not configured with *lch-basedPrioritization*, and the PUSCH duration of the configured uplink grant does not overlap with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or in a Random Access Response or the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload for this Serving Cell:

    - 2> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PUSCH duration;

    - 2> if, for the corresponding HARQ process, the *configuredGrantTimer* is not running and *cg-RetransmissionTimer* is not configured (i.e. new transmission):

      - 3> consider the NDI bit for the corresponding HARQ process to have been toggled;

      - 3> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

    - 2> else if the *cg-RetransmissionTimer* for the corresponding HARQ process is configured and not running, then for the corresponding HARQ process:

      - 3> if the *configuredGrantTimer* is not running, and the HARQ process is not pending (i.e. new transmission):

        - 4> consider the NDI bit to have been toggled;

        - 4> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

      - 3> else if the previous uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same HARQ process was a configured uplink grant (i.e. retransmission on configured grant):

        - 4> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

For configured uplink grants neither configured with *harq-ProcID-Offset2* nor with *cg-RetransmissionTimer*, the HARQ Process ID associated with the first symbol of a UL transmission is derived from the following equation:

HARQ Process ID = [floor(CURRENT_symbol/*periodicity*)] modulo *nrofHARQ-Processes*

For configured uplink grants with *harq-ProcID-Offset2*, the HARQ Process ID associated with the first symbol of a UL transmission is derived from the following equation:

HARQ Process ID = [floor(CURRENT_symbol / *periodicity*)] modulo *nrofHARQ-Processes* + *harq-ProcID-Offset2*

where CURRENT_symbol = (SFN × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot* + slot number in the frame × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot* + symbol number in the slot), and *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* and *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot* refer to the number of consecutive slots per frame and the number of consecutive symbols per slot, respectively as specified in TS 38.211 [[8]](#2-References).

For configured uplink grants configured with *cg-RetransmissionTimer*, the UE implementation selects an HARQ Process ID among the HARQ process IDs available for the configured grant configuration. For HARQ Process ID selection, the UE shall prioritize retransmissions before initial transmissions. The UE shall toggle the NDI in the CG-UCI for new transmissions and not toggle the NDI in the CG-UCI in retransmissions.

NOTE 1: CURRENT_symbol refers to the symbol index of the first transmission occasion of a bundle of configured uplink grant.

NOTE 2: A HARQ process is configured for a configured uplink grant where neither *harq-ProcID-Offset* nor *harq-ProcID-Offset2* is configured, if the configured uplink grant is activated and the associated HARQ process ID is less than *nrofHARQ-Processes*. A HARQ process is configured for a configured uplink grant where *harq-ProcID-Offset2* is configured, if the configured uplink grant is activated and the associated HARQ process ID is greater than or equal to *harq-ProcID-Offset2* and less than sum of *harq-ProcID-Offset2* and *nrofHARQ-Processes* for the configured grant configuration.

NOTE 3: If the MAC entity receives a grant in a Random Access Response (i.e. MAC RAR or fallbackRAR), or addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or determines a grant as specified in clause 5.1.2a for MSGA payload and if the MAC entity also receives an overlapping grant for its C-RNTI or CS-RNTI, requiring concurrent transmissions on the SpCell, the MAC entity may choose to continue with either the grant for its RA-RNTI/Temporary C-RNTI/MSGB-RNTI/the MSGA payload transmission or the grant for its C-RNTI or CS-RNTI.

NOTE 4: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the HARQ Process ID used for configured uplink grants.

NOTE 5: If *cg-RetransmissionTimer* is not configured, a HARQ process is not shared between different configured grant configurations in the same BWP.

For the MAC entity configured with *lch-basedPrioritization*, priority of an uplink grant is determined by the highest priority among priorities of the logical channels that are multiplexed (i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is already stored in the HARQ buffer) or have data available that can be multiplexed (i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is not stored in the HARQ buffer) in the MAC PDU, according to the mapping restrictions as described in clause 5.4.3.1.2. The priority of an uplink grant for which no data for logical channels is multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU is lower than either the priority of an uplink grant for which data for any logical channels is multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU or the priority of the logical channel triggering an SR.

For the MAC entity configured with *lch-basedPrioritization*, if the corresponding PUSCH transmission of a configured uplink grant is cancelled by CI-RNTI as specified in clause 11.2A of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References) or cancelled by a high PHY-priority PUCCH transmission as specified in clause 9 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References), this configured uplink grant is considered as a de-prioritized uplink grant. If this deprioritized uplink grant is configured with *autonomousTx*, the *configuredGrantTimer* for the corresponding HARQ process of this de-prioritized uplink grant shall be stopped if it is running.

When the MAC entity is configured with *lch-basedPrioritization*, for each uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity and whose associated PUSCH can be transmitted by lower layers, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if this uplink grant is received in a Random Access Response (i.e. in a MAC RAR or fallback RAR), or addressed to Temporary C-RNTI, or is determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload:

    - 2> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant.

- 1> else if this uplink grant is addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI = 1 or C-RNTI:

    - 2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of a configured uplink grant which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP whose priority is higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and

    - 2> if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was not already de-prioritized and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:

      - 3> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant;

      - 3> consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized uplink grant(s);

      - 3> consider the other overlapping SR transmission(s), if any, as a de-prioritized SR transmission(s).

- 1> else if this uplink grant is a configured uplink grant:

    - 2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of another configured uplink grant which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and

    - 2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI = 1 or C-RNTI which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is higher than or equal to the priority of the uplink grant; and

    - 2> if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was not already de-prioritized and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:

      - 3> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant;

      - 3> consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized uplink grant(s);

      - 3> if the de-prioritized uplink grant(s) is a configured uplink grant configured with *autonomousTx* whose PUSCH has already started:

        - 4> stop the *configuredGrantTimer* for the corresponding HARQ process of the de-prioritized uplink grant(s).

      - 3> consider the other overlapping SR transmission(s), if any, as a de-prioritized SR transmission(s).

NOTE 6: If the MAC entity is configured with *lch-basedPrioritization* and if there is overlapping PUSCH duration of at least two configured uplink grants whose priorities are equal, the prioritized uplink grant is determined by UE implementation.

NOTE 7: If the MAC entity is not configured with *lch-basedPrioritization* and if there is overlapping PUSCH duration of at least two configured uplink grants, it is up to UE implementation to choose one of the configured uplink grants.

NOTE 8: If the MAC entity is configured with *lch-basedPrioritization*, the MAC entity does not take UCI multiplexing according to the procedure specified in TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References) into account when determining whether the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant overlaps with the PUCCH resource for an SR transmission.

### 5.4.2 HARQ operation

#### 5.4.2.1 HARQ Entity

The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell with configured uplink (including the case when it is configured with *supplementaryUplink*), which maintains a number of parallel HARQ processes.

The number of parallel UL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References).

Each HARQ process supports one TB.

Each HARQ process is associated with a HARQ process identifier. For UL transmission with UL grant in RA Response or for UL transmission for MSGA payload, HARQ process identifier 0 is used.

NOTE: When a single DCI is used to schedule multiple PUSCH, the UE is allowed to map generated TB(s) internally to different HARQ processes in case of LBT failure(s), i.e. UE may transmit a new TB on any HARQ process in the grants that have the same TBS, the same RV and the NDIs indicate new transmission.

The maximum number of transmissions of a TB within a bundle of the dynamic grant or configured grant is given by *REPETITION_NUMBER* as follows:

* For a dynamic grant, *REPETITION_NUMBER* is set to a value provided by lower layers, as specified in clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References);

* For a configured grant, *REPETITION_NUMBER* is set to a value provided by lower layers, as specified in clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References).

If *REPETITION_NUMBER* \> 1, after the first transmission within a bundle, at most *REPETITION_NUMBER* – 1 HARQ retransmissions follow within the bundle. For both dynamic grant and configured uplink grant, bundling operation relies on the HARQ entity for invoking the same HARQ process for each transmission that is part of the same bundle. Within a bundle, HARQ retransmissions are triggered without waiting for feedback from previous transmission according to *REPETITION_NUMBER* for a dynamic grant or configured uplink grant unless they are terminated as specified in clause 6.1 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References). Each transmission within a bundle is a separate uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity.

For each transmission within a bundle of the dynamic grant, the sequence of redundancy versions is determined according to clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References). For each transmission within a bundle of the configured uplink grant, the sequence of redundancy versions is determined according to clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References).

For each uplink grant, the HARQ entity shall:

- 1> identify the HARQ process associated with this grant, and for each identified HARQ process:

    - 2> if the received grant was not addressed to a Temporary C-RNTI on PDCCH, and the NDI provided in the associated HARQ information has been toggled compared to the value in the previous transmission of this TB of this HARQ process; or

    - 2> if the uplink grant was received on PDCCH for the C-RNTI and the HARQ buffer of the identified process is empty; or

    - 2> if the uplink grant was received in a Random Access Response (i.e. in a MAC RAR or a fallback RAR); or

    - 2> if the uplink grant was determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload; or

    - 2> if the uplink grant was received on PDCCH for the C-RNTI in *ra-ResponseWindow* and this PDCCH successfully completed the Random Access procedure initiated for beam failure recovery; or

    - 2> if the uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant, and may be used for initial transmission according to clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References), and if no MAC PDU has been obtained for this bundle:

      - 3> if there is a MAC PDU in the MSGA buffer and the uplink grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload was selected; or

      - 3> if there is a MAC PDU in the MSGA buffer and the uplink grant was received in a fallbackRAR and this fallbackRAR successfully completed the Random Access procedure:

        - 4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the MSGA buffer.

      - 3> else if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was received in a fallbackRAR:

        - 4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Msg3 buffer.

      - 3> else if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was received in a MAC RAR; or:

      - 3> if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was received on PDCCH for the C-RNTI in *ra-ResponseWindow* and this PDCCH successfully completed the Random Access procedure initiated for beam failure recovery:

        - 4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Msg3 buffer.

        - 4> if the uplink grant size does not match with size of the obtained MAC PDU; and

        - 4> if the Random Access procedure was successfully completed upon receiving the uplink grant:

        - 4> if the identified HARQ process is pending and the transmission is performed and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers:

          - 5> consider the identified HARQ process as not pending.

When determining if NDI has been toggled compared to the value in the previous transmission the MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all uplink grants on PDCCH for its Temporary C-RNTI.

When *configuredGrantTimer* or *cg-RetransmissionTimer* is started or restarted by a PUSCH transmission, it shall be started at the beginning of the first symbol of the PUSCH transmission.

#### 5.4.2.2 HARQ process

Each HARQ process is associated with a HARQ buffer.

New transmissions are performed on the resource and with the MCS indicated on PDCCH or indicated in the Random Access Response (i.e. MAC RAR or fallbackRAR), or signalled in RRC or determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for MSGA payload. Retransmissions are performed on the resource and, if provided, with the MCS indicated on PDCCH, or on the same resource and with the same MCS as was used for last made transmission attempt within a bundle, or on stored configured uplink grant resources and stored MCS when *cg-RetransmissionTimer* is configured. If *cg-RetransmissionTimer* is configured, retransmissions with the same HARQ process may be performed on any configured grant configuration if the configured grant configurations have the same TBS.

When *cg-RetransmissionTimer* is configured and the HARQ entity obtains a MAC PDU to transmit and LBT failure indication is received from lower layer, the corresponding HARQ process is considered to be pending. For a configured uplink grant, configured with *cg-RetransmissionTimer*, each associated HARQ process is considered as not pending when:

* a transmission is performed on that HARQ process and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers; or

* the configured uplink grant is initialised and this HARQ process is not associated with another active configured uplink grant; or

* the HARQ buffer for this HARQ process is flushed.

If the HARQ entity requests a new transmission for a TB, the HARQ process shall:

- 1> store the MAC PDU in the associated HARQ buffer;

- 1> store the uplink grant received from the HARQ entity;

- 1> generate a transmission as described below.

If the HARQ entity requests a retransmission for a TB, the HARQ process shall:

- 1> store the uplink grant received from the HARQ entity;

- 1> generate a transmission as described below.

To generate a transmission for a TB, the HARQ process shall:

- 1> if the MAC PDU was obtained from the Msg3 buffer; or

- 1> if the MAC PDU was obtained from the MSGA buffer; or

- 1> if there is no measurement gap at the time of the transmission and, in case of retransmission, the retransmission does not collide with a transmission for a MAC PDU obtained from the Msg3 buffer or the MSGA buffer:

    - 2> if there are neither transmission of NR sidelink communication nor transmission of V2X sidelink communication at the time of the transmission; or

    - 2> if the transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over sidelink transmission or can be simultaneously performed with sidelink transmission:

      - 3> instruct the physical layer to generate a transmission according to the stored uplink grant.

If a HARQ process receives downlink feedback information, the HARQ process shall:

- 1> stop the *cg-RetransmissionTimer*, if running;

- 1> if acknowledgement is indicated:

    - 2> stop the *configuredGrantTimer*, if running.

If the *configuredGrantTimer* expires for a HARQ process, the HARQ process shall:

- 1> stop the *cg-RetransmissionTimer*, if running.

The transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over sidelink transmission or can be performed simultaneously with sidelink transmission if one of the following conditions is met:

* if there are both a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink communication and a configured grant for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as described in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References) at the time of the transmission, and neither the transmission of NR sidelink communication is prioritized as described in clause 5.22.1.3.1a nor the transmissions of V2X sidelink communication is prioritized as described in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References); or

* if there are both a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink communication and a configured grant for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as described in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References) at the time of the transmission, and the MAC PDU includes any MAC CE prioritized as described in clause 5.4.3.1.3 or the value of the highest priority of the logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU is lower than *ul-PrioritizationThres* if *ul-PrioritizationThres* is configured; or

* if there are both a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink communication and a configured grant for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as described in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References) at the time of the transmission, and the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the transmission of NR sidelink communication and/or the transmissions of V2X sidelink communication; or

* if there is only configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as described in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References) at the time of the transmission, and either none of the transmissions of V2X sidelink communication is prioritized as described in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References) or the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the transmissions of V2X sidelink communication; or

* if there is only a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink communication at the time of the transmission, and if the MAC PDU includes any MAC CE prioritized as described in clause 5.4.3.1.3, or the transmission of NR sidelink communication is not prioritized as described in clause 5.22.1.3.1a, or the value of the highest priority of the logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU is lower than *ul-PrioritizationThres* if *ul-PrioritizationThres* is configured, or there is a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink communication at the time of the transmission and the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the transmission of NR sidelink communication; or

* if there are both a sidelink grant for transmission of NR sidelink communication and a configured grant for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as described in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References) at the time of the transmission, and either only the transmission of NR sidelink communication is prioritized as described in clause 5.22.1.3.1a or only the transmissions of V2X sidelink communication is prioritized as described in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References) and the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the prioritized transmission of NR sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication:

NOTE 1: Among the UL transmissions where the MAC entity is able to perform the transmission of NR sidelink communication prioritized simultaneously, if there are more than one UL transmission which the MAC entity is not able to perform simultaneously, it is up to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is performed.

NOTE 2: Among the UL transmissions that the MAC entity is able to perform simultaneously with all transmissions of V2X sidelink communication prioritized, if there are more than one UL transmission which the MAC entity is not able to perform simultaneously, it is up to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is performed.

NOTE 3: Among the UL transmissions where the MAC entity is able to perform the transmission of NR sidelink communication prioritized simultaneously with all transmissions of V2X sidelink communication prioritized, if there are more than one UL transmission which the MAC entity is not able to perform simultaneously, it is up to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is performed.

NOTE 4: If there is a configured grant for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as described in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References) at the time of the transmission, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the transmission of V2X sidelink communication, and prioritization-related information is not available prior to the time of the transmission due to processing time restriction, it is up to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is performed.

### 5.4.3 Multiplexing and assembly

#### 5.4.3.1 Logical Channel Prioritization

##### 5.4.3.1.1 General

The Logical Channel Prioritization (LCP) procedure is applied whenever a new transmission is performed.

RRC controls the scheduling of uplink data by signalling for each logical channel per MAC entity:

* *priority* where an increasing priority value indicates a lower priority level;

* *prioritisedBitRate* which sets the Prioritized Bit Rate (PBR);

* *bucketSizeDuration* which sets the Bucket Size Duration (BSD).

RRC additionally controls the LCP procedure by configuring mapping restrictions for each logical channel:

* *allowedSCS-List* which sets the allowed Subcarrier Spacing(s) for transmission;

* *maxPUSCH-Duration* which sets the maximum PUSCH duration allowed for transmission;

* *configuredGrantType1Allowed* which sets whether a configured grant Type 1 can be used for transmission;

* *allowedServingCells* which sets the allowed cell(s) for transmission;

* *allowedCG-List* which sets the allowed configured grant(s) for transmission;

* *allowedPHY-PriorityIndex* which sets the allowed PHY priority index(es) of a dynamic grant for transmission.

The following UE variable is used for the Logical channel prioritization procedure:

* *Bj* which is maintained for each logical channel *j*.

The MAC entity shall initialize *Bj* of the logical channel to zero when the logical channel is established.

For each logical channel *j*, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> increment *Bj* by the product PBR × T before every instance of the LCP procedure, where T is the time elapsed since *Bj* was last incremented;

- 1> if the value of *Bj* is greater than the bucket size (i.e. PBR × BSD):

    - 2> set *Bj* to the bucket size.

NOTE: The exact moment(s) when the UE updates *Bj* between LCP procedures is up to UE implementation, as long as *Bj* is up to date at the time when a grant is processed by LCP.

##### 5.4.3.1.2 Selection of logical channels

The MAC entity shall, when a new transmission is performed:

- 1> select the logical channels for each UL grant that satisfy all the following conditions:

    - 2> the set of allowed Subcarrier Spacing index values in *allowedSCS-List*, if configured, includes the Subcarrier Spacing index associated to the UL grant; and

    - 2> *maxPUSCH-Duration*, if configured, is larger than or equal to the PUSCH transmission duration associated to the UL grant; and

    - 2> *configuredGrantType1Allowed*, if configured, is set to *true* in case the UL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and

    - 2> *allowedServingCells*, if configured, includes the Cell information associated to the UL grant. Does not apply to logical channels associated with a DRB configured with PDCP duplication within the same MAC entity (i.e. CA duplication) when CA duplication is deactivated for this DRB in this MAC entity; and

    - 2> *allowedCG-List*, if configured, includes the configured grant index associated to the UL grant; and

    - 2> *allowedPHY-PriorityIndex*, if configured, includes the priority index (as specified in clause 9 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References)) associated to the dynamic UL grant.

NOTE: The Subcarrier Spacing index, PUSCH transmission duration, Cell information, and priority index are included in Uplink transmission information received from lower layers for the corresponding scheduled uplink transmission.

##### 5.4.3.1.3 Allocation of resources

Before the successful completion of the Random Access procedure initiated for DAPS handover, the target MAC entity shall not select the logical channel(s) corresponding to non-DAPS DRB(s) for the uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or the uplink grant for the transmission of the MSGA payload. The source MAC entity shall select only the logical channel(s) corresponding to DAPS DRB(s) during DAPS handover.

The MAC entity shall, when a new transmission is performed:

- 1> allocate resources to the logical channels as follows:

    - 2> logical channels selected in clause 5.4.3.1.2 for the UL grant with *Bj* \> 0 are allocated resources in a decreasing priority order. If the PBR of a logical channel is set to *infinity*, the MAC entity shall allocate resources for all the data that is available for transmission on the logical channel before meeting the PBR of the lower priority logical channel(s);

    - 2> decrement *Bj* by the total size of MAC SDUs served to logical channel *j* above;

    - 2> if any resources remain, all the logical channels selected in clause 5.4.3.1.2 are served in a strict decreasing priority order (regardless of the value of *Bj*) until either the data for that logical channel or the UL grant is exhausted, whichever comes first. Logical channels configured with equal priority should be served equally.

NOTE 1: The value of *Bj* can be negative.

If the MAC entity is requested to simultaneously transmit multiple MAC PDUs, or if the MAC entity receives the multiple UL grants within one or more coinciding PDCCH occasions (i.e. on different Serving Cells), it is up to UE implementation in which order the grants are processed.

The UE shall also follow the rules below during the scheduling procedures above:

* the UE should not segment an RLC SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or retransmitted RLC PDU) if the whole SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or retransmitted RLC PDU) fits into the remaining resources of the associated MAC entity;

* if the UE segments an RLC SDU from the logical channel, it shall maximize the size of the segment to fill the grant of the associated MAC entity as much as possible;

* the UE should maximise the transmission of data;

* if the MAC entity is given a UL grant size that is equal to or larger than 8 bytes (when eLCID is not used) or 10 bytes (when eLCID is used) while having data available and allowed (according to clause 5.4.3.1) for transmission, the MAC entity shall not transmit only padding BSR and/or padding.

The MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the MAC entity is configured with *enhancedSkipUplinkTxDynamic* with value *true* and the grant indicated to the HARQ entity was addressed to a C-RNTI, or if the MAC entity is configured with *enhancedSkipUplinkTxConfigured* with value *true* and the grant indicated to the HARQ entity is a configured uplink grant:

    - 2> if there is no UCI to be multiplexed on this PUSCH transmission as specified in TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References); and

    - 2> if there is no aperiodic CSI requested for this PUSCH transmission as specified in TS 38.212 [[9]](#2-References); and

    - 2> if the MAC PDU includes zero MAC SDUs; and

    - 2> if the MAC PDU includes only the periodic BSR and there is no data available for any LCG, or the MAC PDU includes only the padding BSR:

      - 3> not generate a MAC PDU for the HARQ entity.

- 1> else if the MAC entity is configured with *skipUplinkTxDynamic* with value *true* and the grant indicated to the HARQ entity was addressed to a C-RNTI, or the grant indicated to the HARQ entity is a configured uplink grant; and

- 1> if there is no aperiodic CSI requested for this PUSCH transmission as specified in TS 38.212 [[9]](#2-References); and

- 1> if the MAC PDU includes zero MAC SDUs; and

- 1> if the MAC PDU includes only the periodic BSR and there is no data available for any LCG, or the MAC PDU includes only the padding BSR:

    - 2> not generate a MAC PDU for the HARQ entity.

Logical channels shall be prioritised in accordance with the following order (highest priority listed first):

* C-RNTI MAC CE or data from UL-CCCH;

* Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE or BFR MAC CE or Multiple Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE;

* Sidelink Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE;

* LBT failure MAC CE;

* MAC CE for SL-BSR prioritized according to clause 5.22.1.6;

* MAC CE for BSR, with exception of BSR included for padding;

* Single Entry PHR MAC CE or Multiple Entry PHR MAC CE;

* MAC CE for the number of Desired Guard Symbols;

* MAC CE for Pre-emptive BSR;

* MAC CE for SL-BSR, with exception of SL-BSR prioritized according to clause 5.22.1.6 and SL-BSR included for padding;

* data from any Logical Channel, except data from UL-CCCH;

* MAC CE for Recommended bit rate query;

* MAC CE for BSR included for padding;

* MAC CE for SL-BSR included for padding.

NOTE 2: Prioritization among Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE, Multiple Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE, and BFR MAC CE is up to UE implementation.

The MAC entity shall prioritize any MAC CE listed in a higher order than 'data from any Logical Channel, except data from UL-CCCH' over transmission of NR sidelink communication.

#### 5.4.3.2 Multiplexing of MAC Control Elements and MAC SDUs

The MAC entity shall multiplex MAC CEs and MAC SDUs in a MAC PDU according to clauses 5.4.3.1 and 6.1.2.

NOTE: Content of a MAC PDU does not change after being built for transmission on a dynamic uplink grant, regardless of LBT outcome.

### 5.4.4 Scheduling Request

The Scheduling Request (SR) is used for requesting UL-SCH resources for new transmission.

The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP.

Each SR configuration corresponds to one or more logical channels and/or to SCell beam failure recovery and/or to consistent LBT failure recovery. Each logical channel, SCell beam failure recovery, and consistent LBT failure recovery, may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured by RRC. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered a BSR (clause 5.4.5) or the SCell beam failure recovery or the consistent LBT failure recovery (clause 5.21) (if such a configuration exists) is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR. Any SR configuration may be used for an SR triggered by Pre-emptive BSR (clause 5.4.7).

RRC configures the following parameters for the scheduling request procedure:

* *sr-ProhibitTimer* (per SR configuration);

* *sr-TransMax* (per SR configuration).

The following UE variables are used for the scheduling request procedure:

* *SR_COUNTER* (per SR configuration).

If an SR is triggered and there are no other SRs pending corresponding to the same SR configuration, the MAC entity shall set the *SR_COUNTER* of the corresponding SR configuration to 0.

When an SR is triggered, it shall be considered as pending until it is cancelled.

All pending SR(s) for BSR triggered according to the BSR procedure (clause 5.4.5) prior to the MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled and each respective *sr-ProhibitTimer* shall be stopped when the MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a Long or Short BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered a BSR (see clause 5.4.5) prior to the MAC PDU assembly. All pending SR(s) for BSR triggered according to the BSR procedure (clause 5.4.5) shall be cancelled and each respective *sr-ProhibitTimer* shall be stopped when the UL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission.

The MAC entity shall for each pending SR not triggered according to the BSR procedure (clause 5.4.5) for a Serving Cell:

- 1> if this SR was triggered by Pre-emptive BSR procedure (see clause 5.4.7) prior to the MAC PDU assembly and a MAC PDU containing the relevant Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE is transmitted; or

- 1> if this SR was triggered by beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) of an SCell and a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a BFR MAC CE or a Truncated BFR MAC CE which contains beam failure recovery information for this SCell; or

- 1> if this SR was triggered by beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) of an SCell and this SCell is deactivated (see clause 5.9); or

- 1> if this SR was triggered by consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21) of an SCell and a MAC PDU is transmitted and the MAC PDU includes an LBT failure MAC CE that indicates consistent LBT failure for this SCell; or

- 1> if this SR was triggered by consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21) of an SCell and all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) for this SCell are cancelled:

    - 2> cancel the pending SR and stop the corresponding *sr-ProhibitTimer*, if running.

Only PUCCH resources on a BWP which is active at the time of SR transmission occasion are considered valid.

As long as at least one SR is pending, the MAC entity shall for each pending SR:

- 1> if the MAC entity has no valid PUCCH resource configured for the pending SR:

    - 2> initiate a Random Access procedure (see clause 5.1) on the SpCell and cancel the pending SR.

- 1> else, for the SR configuration corresponding to the pending SR:

    - 2> when the MAC entity has an SR transmission occasion on the valid PUCCH resource for SR configured; and

    - 2> if *sr-ProhibitTimer* is not running at the time of the SR transmission occasion; and

    - 2> if the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion does not overlap with a measurement gap:

      - 3> if the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion overlaps with neither a UL-SCH resource nor an SL-SCH resource; or

      - 3> if the MAC entity is able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource; or

      - 3> if the MAC entity is configured with *lch-basedPrioritization*, and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion does not overlap with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or with the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload, and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.4.5 overlaps with any other UL-SCH resource(s), and the physical layer can signal the SR on one valid PUCCH resource for SR, and the priority of the logical channel that triggered SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant(s) for any UL-SCH resource(s) where the uplink grant was not already de-prioritized, and the priority of the uplink grant is determined as specified in clause 5.4.1; or

      - 3> if both *sl-PrioritizationThres* and *ul-PrioritizationThres* are configured and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 overlaps with any UL-SCH resource(s) carrying a MAC PDU, and the value of the priority of the triggered SR determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 is lower than *sl-PrioritizationThres* and the value of the highest priority of the logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU is higher than or eqaul to *ul-PrioritizationThres* and the MAC PDU is not prioritized by upper layer according to TS 23.287 [[19]](#2-References); or

      - 3> if a SL-SCH resource overlaps with the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.4.5, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource, and either transmission on the SL-SCH resource is not prioritized as described in clause 5.22.1.3.1a or the priority value of the logical channel that triggered SR is lower than *ul-PrioritizationThres*, if configured; or

      - 3> if a SL-SCH resource overlaps with the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.22.1.5, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource, and the priority of the triggered SR determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 is higher than the priority of the MAC PDU determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a for the SL-SCH resource:

        - 4> consider the SR transmission as a prioritized SR transmission.

        - 4> consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized uplink grant(s);

        - 4> if the de-prioritized uplink grant(s) is a configured uplink grant configured with *autonomousTx* whose PUSCH has already started:

          - 5> stop the *configuredGrantTimer* for the corresponding HARQ process of the de-prioritized uplink grant(s).

        - 4> if *SR_COUNTER* \< *sr-TransMax*:

          - 5> instruct the physical layer to signal the SR on one valid PUCCH resource for SR;

          - 5> if LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers:

            - 6> increment *SR_COUNTER* by 1;

            - 6> start the *sr-ProhibitTimer*.

          - 5> else if *lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig* is not configured:

            - 6> increment *SR_COUNTER* by 1.

        - 4> else:

          - 5> notify RRC to release PUCCH for all Serving Cells;

          - 5> notify RRC to release SRS for all Serving Cells;

          - 5> clear any configured downlink assignments and uplink grants;

          - 5> clear any PUSCH resources for semi-persistent CSI reporting;

          - 5> initiate a Random Access procedure (see clause 5.1) on the SpCell and cancel all pending SRs.

      - 3> else:

        - 4> consider the SR transmission as a de-prioritized SR transmission.

NOTE 1: Except for SR for SCell beam failure recovery, the selection of which valid PUCCH resource for SR to signal SR on when the MAC entity has more than one overlapping valid PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion is left to UE implementation.

NOTE 2: If more than one individual SR triggers an instruction from the MAC entity to the PHY layer to signal the SR on the same valid PUCCH resource, the *SR_COUNTER* for the relevant SR configuration is incremented only once.

NOTE 3: When the MAC entity has pending SR for SCell beam failure recovery and the MAC entity has one or more PUCCH resources overlapping with PUCCH resource for SCell beam failure recovery for the SR transmission occasion, the MAC entity considers only the PUCCH resource for SCell beam failure recovery as valid.

NOTE 4: For a UE operating in a semi-static channel access mode as described in TS 37.213 [[18]](#2-References), PUCCH resources overlapping with the set of consecutive symbols where the UE does not transmit before the start of a next channel occupancy time are not considered valid.

NOTE 5: If the MAC entity is configured with *lch-basedPrioritization,* the MAC entity does not take UCI multiplexing according to the procedure specified in TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References) into account when determining whether the valid PUCCH resource for the SR transmission can be signalled by the physical layer and the SR transmission occasion overlaps with the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant of a MSGA payload.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for BSR, which was initiated by the MAC entity prior to the MAC PDU assembly and which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:

* a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes a BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered a BSR (see clause 5.4.5) prior to the MAC PDU assembly; or

* the UL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for SL-BSR and/or SL-CSI reporting, which was initiated by the MAC entity prior to the sidelink MAC PDU assembly and which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:

* a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes a SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered a SL-BSR (see clause 5.22.1.6) prior to the MAC PDU assembly; or

* the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available and/or SL-CSI reporting MAC CE for transmission.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for BFR of an SCell, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:

* a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU contains a BFR MAC CE or a Truncated BFR MAC CE which includes beam failure recovery information of that SCell; or

* the SCell is deactivated (as specified in clause 5.9) and all triggered BFRs for SCells are cancelled.

The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a pending SR for consistent LBT failure recovery, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:

* a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes an LBT failure MAC CE that indicates consistent LBT failure for all the SCells that triggered consistent LBT failure; or

* all the SCells that triggered consistent LBT failure recovery are deactivated (see clause 5.9).

### 5.4.5 Buffer Status Reporting

The Buffer Status reporting (BSR) procedure is used to provide the serving gNB with information about UL data volume in the MAC entity.

RRC configures the following parameters to control the BSR:

* *periodicBSR-Timer*;

* *retxBSR-Timer*;

* *logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied*;

* *logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer*;

* *logicalChannelSR-Mask*;

* *logicalChannelGroup*.

Each logical channel may be allocated to an LCG using the *logicalChannelGroup*. The maximum number of LCGs is eight.

The MAC entity determines the amount of UL data available for a logical channel according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [[3]](#2-References) and 38.323 [[4]](#2-References).

A BSR shall be triggered if any of the following events occur:

* UL data, for a logical channel which belongs to an LCG, becomes available to the MAC entity; and either

* this UL data belongs to a logical channel with higher priority than the priority of any logical channel containing available UL data which belong to any LCG; or

* none of the logical channels which belong to an LCG contains any available UL data.

in which case the BSR is referred below to as 'Regular BSR';

* UL resources are allocated and number of padding bits is equal to or larger than the size of the Buffer Status Report MAC CE plus its subheader, in which case the BSR is referred below to as 'Padding BSR';

* *retxBSR-Timer* expires, and at least one of the logical channels which belong to an LCG contains UL data, in which case the BSR is referred below to as 'Regular BSR';

* *periodicBSR-Timer* expires, in which case the BSR is referred below to as 'Periodic BSR'.

NOTE 1: When Regular BSR triggering events occur for multiple logical channels simultaneously, each logical channel triggers one separate Regular BSR.

For Regular BSR, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the BSR is triggered for a logical channel for which *logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied* with value *true* is configured by upper layers:

    - 2> start or restart the *logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer*.

- 1> else:

    - 2> if running, stop the *logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer*.

For Regular and Periodic BSR, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if more than one LCG has data available for transmission when the MAC PDU containing the BSR is to be built:

    - 2> report Long BSR for all LCGs which have data available for transmission.

- 1> else:

    - 2> report Short BSR.

For Padding BSR, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the number of padding bits is equal to or larger than the size of the Short BSR plus its subheader but smaller than the size of the Long BSR plus its subheader:

    - 2> if more than one LCG has data available for transmission when the BSR is to be built:

      - 3> if the number of padding bits is equal to the size of the Short BSR plus its subheader:

        - 4> report Short Truncated BSR of the LCG with the highest priority logical channel with data available for transmission.

      - 3> else:

        - 4> report Long Truncated BSR of the LCG(s) with the logical channels having data available for transmission following a decreasing order of the highest priority logical channel (with or without data available for transmission) in each of these LCG(s), and in case of equal priority, in increasing order of LCGID.

    - 2> else:

      - 3> report Short BSR.

- 1> else if the number of padding bits is equal to or larger than the size of the Long BSR plus its subheader:

    - 2> report Long BSR for all LCGs which have data available for transmission.

For BSR triggered by *retxBSR-Timer* expiry, the MAC entity considers that the logical channel that triggered the BSR is the highest priority logical channel that has data available for transmission at the time the BSR is triggered.

The MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least one BSR has been triggered and not cancelled:

    - 2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the BSR MAC CE(s) as defined in clause 6.1.3.1;

      - 3> start or restart *periodicBSR-Timer* except when all the generated BSRs are long or short Truncated BSRs;

      - 3> start or restart *retxBSR-Timer*.

    - 2> if a Regular BSR has been triggered and *logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer* is not running:

      - 3> if there is no UL-SCH resource available for a new transmission; or

      - 3> if the MAC entity is configured with configured uplink grant(s) and the Regular BSR was triggered for a logical channel for which *logicalChannelSR-Mask* is set to *false*; or

      - 3> if the UL-SCH resources available for a new transmission do not meet the LCP mapping restrictions (see clause 5.4.3.1) configured for the logical channel that triggered the BSR:

        - 4> trigger a Scheduling Request.

NOTE 2: UL-SCH resources are considered available if the MAC entity has been configured with, receives, or determines an uplink grant. If the MAC entity has determined at a given point in time that UL-SCH resources are available, this need not imply that UL-SCH resources are available for use at that point in time.

A MAC PDU shall contain at most one BSR MAC CE, even when multiple events have triggered a BSR. The Regular BSR and the Periodic BSR shall have precedence over the padding BSR.

The MAC entity shall restart *retxBSR-Timer* upon reception of a grant for transmission of new data on any UL-SCH.

All triggered BSRs may be cancelled when the UL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission but is not sufficient to additionally accommodate the BSR MAC CE plus its subheader. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a Long or Short BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered a BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly.

NOTE 3: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. BSR and SR can be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains a BSR MAC CE, but before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, BSR and SR can be triggered during MAC PDU assembly.

NOTE 4: Void

NOTE 5: If a HARQ process is configured with *cg-RetransmissionTimer* and if the BSR is already included in a MAC PDU for transmission on configured grant by this HARQ process, but not yet transmitted by lower layers, it is up to UE implementation how to handle the BSR content.

### 5.4.6 Power Headroom Reporting

The Power Headroom reporting procedure is used to provide the serving gNB with the following information:

* Type 1 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum transmit power and the estimated power for UL-SCH transmission per activated Serving Cell;

* Type 2 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum transmit power and the estimated power for UL-SCH and PUCCH transmission on SpCell of the other MAC entity (i.e. E-UTRA MAC entity in EN-DC, NE-DC, and NGEN-DC cases);

* Type 3 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum transmit power and the estimated power for SRS transmission per activated Serving Cell;

* MPE P-MPR: the power backoff to meet the MPE FR2 requirements for a Serving Cell operating on FR2.

RRC controls Power Headroom reporting by configuring the following parameters:

* *phr-PeriodicTimer*;

* *phr-ProhibitTimer*;

* *phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange*;

* *phr-Type2OtherCell*;

* *phr-ModeOtherCG*;

* *multiplePHR*;

* *mpe-Reporting-FR2*;

* *mpe-ProhibitTimer*;

* *mpe-Threshold*.

A Power Headroom Report (PHR) shall be triggered if any of the following events occur:

* *phr-ProhibitTimer* expires or has expired and the path loss has changed more than *phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange* dB for at least one activated Serving Cell of any MAC entity of which the active DL BWP is not dormant BWP which is used as a pathloss reference since the last transmission of a PHR in this MAC entity when the MAC entity has UL resources for new transmission;

NOTE 1: The path loss variation for one cell assessed above is between the pathloss measured at present time on the current pathloss reference and the pathloss measured at the transmission time of the last transmission of PHR on the pathloss reference in use at that time, irrespective of whether the pathloss reference has changed in between. The current pathloss reference for this purpose does not include any pathloss reference configured using pathlossReferenceRS-Pos in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References).

* *phr-PeriodicTimer* expires;

* upon configuration or reconfiguration of the power headroom reporting functionality by upper layers, which is not used to disable the function;

* activation of an SCell of any MAC entity with configured uplink of which *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* is not set to dormant BWP;

* addition of the PSCell (i.e. PSCell is newly added or changed);

* *phr-ProhibitTimer* expires or has expired, when the MAC entity has UL resources for new transmission, and the following is true for any of the activated Serving Cells of any MAC entity with configured uplink:

* there are UL resources allocated for transmission or there is a PUCCH transmission on this cell, and the required power backoff due to power management (as allowed by P-MPRc as specified in TS 38.101-1 [[14]](#2-References), TS 38.101-2 [[15]](#2-References), and TS 38.101-3 [[16]](#2-References)) for this cell has changed more than *phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange* dB since the last transmission of a PHR when the MAC entity had UL resources allocated for transmission or PUCCH transmission on this cell.

* Upon switching of activated BWP from dormant BWP to non-dormant DL BWP of an SCell of any MAC entity with configured uplink;

* if *mpe-Reporting-FR2* is configured, and *mpe-ProhibitTimer* is not running:

* the measured P-MPR applied to meet FR2 MPE requirements as specified in TS 38.101-2 [[15]](#2-References) is equal to or larger than *mpe-Threshold* for at least one activated FR2 Serving Cell since the last transmission of a PHR in this MAC entity; or

* the measured P-MPR applied to meet FR2 MPE requirements as specified in TS 38.101-2 [[15]](#2-References) has changed more than *phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange* dB for at least one activated FR2 Serving Cell since the last transmission of a PHR due to the measured P-MPR applied to meet MPE requirements being equal to or larger than *mpe-Threshold* in this MAC entity.

in which case the PHR is referred below to as 'MPE P-MPR report'.

NOTE 2: The MAC entity should avoid triggering a PHR when the required power backoff due to power management decreases only temporarily (e.g. for up to a few tens of milliseconds) and it should avoid reflecting such temporary decrease in the values of PCMAX,f,c/PH when a PHR is triggered by other triggering conditions.

NOTE 3: If a HARQ process is configured with *cg-RetransmissionTimer* and if the PHR is already included in a MAC PDU for transmission on configured grant by this HARQ process, but not yet transmitted by lower layers, it is up to UE implementation how to handle the PHR content.

If the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for a new transmission the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if it is the first UL resource allocated for a new transmission since the last MAC reset:

    - 2> start *phr-PeriodicTimer*.

- 1> if the Power Headroom reporting procedure determines that at least one PHR has been triggered and not cancelled; and

- 1> if the allocated UL resources can accommodate the MAC CE for PHR which the MAC entity is configured to transmit, plus its subheader, as a result of LCP as defined in clause 5.4.3.1:

    - 2> if *multiplePHR* with value *true* is configured:

      - 3> for each activated Serving Cell with configured uplink associated with any MAC entity of which the active DL BWP is not dormant BWP; and

      - 3> for each activated Serving Cell with configured uplink associated with E-UTRA MAC entity:

        - 4> obtain the value of the Type 1 or Type 3 power headroom for the corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References) for NR Serving Cell and clause 5.1.1.2 of TS 36.213 [[17]](#2-References) for E-UTRA Serving Cell;

        - 4> if this MAC entity has UL resources allocated for transmission on this Serving Cell; or

        - 4> if the other MAC entity, if configured, has UL resources allocated for transmission on this Serving Cell and *phr-ModeOtherCG* is set to *real* by upper layers:

          - 5> obtain the value for the corresponding PCMAX,f,c field from the physical layer.

          - 5> if *mpe-Reporting-FR2* is configured and this Serving Cell operates on FR2 and this Serving Cell is associated to this MAC entity:

            - 6> obtain the value for the corresponding MPE field from the physical layer.

      - 3> if *phr-Type2OtherCell* with value *true* is configured:

        - 4> if the other MAC entity is E-UTRA MAC entity:

          - 5> obtain the value of the Type 2 power headroom for the SpCell of the other MAC entity (i.e. E-UTRA MAC entity);

          - 5> if *phr-ModeOtherCG* is set to *real* by upper layers:

            - 6> obtain the value for the corresponding PCMAX,f,c field for the SpCell of the other MAC entity (i.e. E-UTRA MAC entity) from the physical layer.

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate and transmit the Multiple Entry PHR MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.9 based on the values reported by the physical layer.

    - 2> else (i.e. Single Entry PHR format is used):

      - 3> obtain the value of the Type 1 power headroom from the physical layer for the corresponding uplink carrier of the PCell;

      - 3> obtain the value for the corresponding PCMAX,f,c field from the physical layer;

      - 3> if *mpe-Reporting-FR2* is configured and this Serving Cell operates on FR2:

        - 4> obtain the value for the corresponding MPE field from the physical layer.

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate and transmit the Single Entry PHR MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.8 based on the values reported by the physical layer.

    - 2> if this PHR report is an MPE P-MPR report:

      - 3> start or restart the *mpe-ProhibitTimer*;

      - 3> cancel triggered MPE P-MPR reporting for Serving Cells included in the PHR MAC CE.

    - 2> start or restart *phr-PeriodicTimer*;

    - 2> start or restart *phr-ProhibitTimer*;

    - 2> cancel all triggered PHR(s).

### 5.4.7 Pre-emptive Buffer Status Reporting

The Pre-emptive Buffer Status reporting (Pre-emptive BSR) procedure is used by an IAB-MT to provide its parent IAB-DU(s) or IAB-donor-DU(s) with the information about the amount of the data expected to arrive at the IAB-MT from its child node(s) and/or UE(s) connected to it.

If configured, Pre-emptive BSR may be triggered for the specific case of an IAB-MT if any of the following events occur:

* UL grant is provided to child IAB node or UE;

* BSR is received from child IAB node or UE.

The MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the Pre-emptive Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least one Pre-emptive BSR has been triggered and not cancelled:

    - 2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.1.

    - 2> else:

      - 3> trigger a Scheduling Request.

A MAC PDU shall contain at most one Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE, even when multiple events have triggered a Pre-emptive BSR.

All triggered Pre-emptive BSR(s) shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes the corresponding Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE.

NOTE: Pre-emptive BSR may be used for the case of dual-connected IAB node. It is up to network implementation to work out the associated MAC entity or entities which report the Pre-emptive BSR, and the associated expected amount of data reported by any such entity or entities. For the case of dual-connected IAB node, if two ingress BH RLC channels belonging to the same ingress LCG are mapped to two different egress Cell Groups (corresponding to different parent nodes), there may be ambiguity in Pre-emptive BSR calculations and interpretation by the receiving parent node(s) and the IAB node reporting pre-emptive BSR.

## 5.5 PCH reception

When the MAC entity needs to receive PCH, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if a PCH assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the P-RNTI:

    - 2> attempt to decode the TB on the PCH as indicated by the PDCCH information;

    - 2> if the TB on the PCH has been successfully decoded:

      - 3> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.

## 5.6 BCH reception

When the MAC entity needs to receive BCH, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> receive and attempt to decode the BCH;

- 1> if a TB on the BCH has been successfully decoded:

    - 2> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.

## 5.7 Discontinuous Reception (DRX)

The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a DRX functionality that controls the UE's PDCCH monitoring activity for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, CI-RNTI, CS-RNTI, INT-RNTI, SFI-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, TPC-SRS-RNTI, and AI-RNTI. When using DRX operation, the MAC entity shall also monitor PDCCH according to requirements found in other clauses of this specification. When in RRC_CONNECTED, if DRX is configured, for all the activated Serving Cells, the MAC entity may monitor the PDCCH discontinuously using the DRX operation specified in this clause; otherwise the MAC entity shall monitor the PDCCH as specified in TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References).

NOTE 1: If Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 is configured by RRC, a DRX functionality is not configured.

RRC controls DRX operation by configuring the following parameters:

* *drx-onDurationTimer*: the duration at the beginning of a DRX cycle;

* *drx-SlotOffset*: the delay before starting the *drx-onDurationTimer*;

* *drx-InactivityTimer*: the duration after the PDCCH occasion in which a PDCCH indicates a new UL or DL transmission for the MAC entity;

* *drx-RetransmissionTimerDL* (per DL HARQ process except for the broadcast process): the maximum duration until a DL retransmission is received;

* *drx-RetransmissionTimerUL* (per UL HARQ process): the maximum duration until a grant for UL retransmission is received;

* *drx-LongCycleStartOffset*: the Long DRX cycle and *drx-StartOffset* which defines the subframe where the Long and Short DRX cycle starts;

* *drx-ShortCycle* (optional): the Short DRX cycle;

* *drx-ShortCycleTimer* (optional): the duration the UE shall follow the Short DRX cycle;

* *drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL* (per DL HARQ process except for the broadcast process): the minimum duration before a DL assignment for HARQ retransmission is expected by the MAC entity;

* *drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL* (per UL HARQ process): the minimum duration before a UL HARQ retransmission grant is expected by the MAC entity;

* *ps-Wakeup* (optional): the configuration to start associated *drx-onDurationTimer* in case DCP is monitored but not detected;

* *ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI* (optional): the configuration to report periodic CSI that is not L1-RSRP on PUCCH during the time duration indicated by *drx-onDurationTimer* in case DCP is configured but associated *drx-onDurationTimer* is not started;

* *ps-TransmitPeriodicL1-RSRP* (optional): the configuration to transmit periodic CSI that is L1-RSRP on PUCCH during the time duration indicated by *drx-onDurationTimer* in case DCP is configured but associated *drx-onDurationTimer* is not started.

Serving Cells of a MAC entity may be configured by RRC in two DRX groups with separate DRX parameters. When RRC does not configure a secondary DRX group, there is only one DRX group and all Serving Cells belong to that one DRX group. When two DRX groups are configured, each Serving Cell is uniquely assigned to either of the two groups. The DRX parameters that are separately configured for each DRX group are: *drx-onDurationTimer*, *drx-InactivityTimer*. The DRX parameters that are common to the DRX groups are: *drx-SlotOffset*, *drx-RetransmissionTimerDL*, *drx-RetransmissionTimerUL*, *drx-LongCycleStartOffset*, *drx-ShortCycle* (optional), *drx-ShortCycleTimer* (optional), *drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL*, and *drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL*.

When DRX is configured, the Active Time for Serving Cells in a DRX group includes the time while:

* *drx-onDurationTimer* or *drx-InactivityTimer* configured for the DRX group is running; or

* *drx-RetransmissionTimerDL* or *drx-RetransmissionTimerUL* is running on any Serving Cell in the DRX group; or

* *ra-ContentionResolutionTimer* (as described in clause 5.1.5) or *msgB-ResponseWindow* (as described in clause 5.1.4a) is running; or

* a Scheduling Request is sent on PUCCH and is pending (as described in clause 5.4.4); or

* a PDCCH indicating a new transmission addressed to the C-RNTI of the MAC entity has not been received after successful reception of a Random Access Response for the Random Access Preamble not selected by the MAC entity among the contention-based Random Access Preamble (as described in clauses 5.1.4 and 5.1.4a).

When DRX is configured, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment:

    - 2> start the *drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL* for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL HARQ feedback;

    - 2> stop the *drx-RetransmissionTimerDL* for the corresponding HARQ process.

- 1> if a MAC PDU is transmitted in a configured uplink grant and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers:

    - 2> start the *drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL* for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the end of the first transmission (within a bundle) of the corresponding PUSCH transmission;

    - 2> stop the *drx-RetransmissionTimerUL* for the corresponding HARQ process at the first transmission (within a bundle) of the corresponding PUSCH transmission.

- 1> if a *drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL* expires:

    - 2> if the data of the corresponding HARQ process was not successfully decoded:

      - 3> start the *drx-RetransmissionTimerDL* for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the expiry of *drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL*.

- 1> if a *drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL* expires:

    - 2> start the *drx-RetransmissionTimerUL* for the corresponding HARQ process in the first symbol after the expiry of *drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerUL*.

- 1> if a DRX Command MAC CE or a Long DRX Command MAC CE is received:

    - 2> stop *drx-onDurationTimer* for each DRX group;

    - 2> stop *drx-InactivityTimer* for each DRX group.

- 1> if *drx-InactivityTimer* for a DRX group expires:

    - 2> if the Short DRX cycle is configured:

      - 3> start or restart *drx-ShortCycleTimer* for this DRX group in the first symbol after the expiry of *drx-InactivityTimer*;

      - 3> use the Short DRX cycle for this DRX group.

    - 2> else:

      - 3> use the Long DRX cycle for this DRX group.

- 1> if a DRX Command MAC CE is received:

    - 2> if the Short DRX cycle is configured:

      - 3> start or restart *drx-ShortCycleTimer* for each DRX group in the first symbol after the end of DRX Command MAC CE reception;

      - 3> use the Short DRX cycle for each DRX group.

    - 2> else:

      - 3> use the Long DRX cycle for each DRX group.

- 1> if *drx-ShortCycleTimer* for a DRX group expires:

    - 2> use the Long DRX cycle for this DRX group.

- 1> if a Long DRX Command MAC CE is received:

    - 2> stop *drx-ShortCycleTimer* for each DRX group;

    - 2> use the Long DRX cycle for each DRX group.

NOTE 4: If a UE multiplexes a CSI configured on PUCCH with other overlapping UCI(s) according to the procedure specified in TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References) clause 9.2.5 and this CSI multiplexed with other UCI(s) would be reported on a PUCCH resource either outside DRX Active Time of the DRX group in which this PUCCH is configured or outside the on-duration period of the DRX group in which this PUCCH is configured if CSI masking is setup by upper layers, it is up to UE implementation whether to report this CSI multiplexed with other UCI(s).

Regardless of whether the MAC entity is monitoring PDCCH or not on the Serving Cells in a DRX group, the MAC entity transmits HARQ feedback, aperiodic CSI on PUSCH, and aperiodic SRS defined in TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References) on the Serving Cells in the DRX group when such is expected.

The MAC entity needs not to monitor the PDCCH if it is not a complete PDCCH occasion (e.g. the Active Time starts or ends in the middle of a PDCCH occasion).

## 5.8 Transmission and reception without dynamic scheduling

### 5.8.1 Downlink

Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) is configured by RRC for a Serving Cell per BWP. Multiple assignments can be active simultaneously in the same BWP. Activation and deactivation of the DL SPS are independent among the Serving Cells.

For the DL SPS, a DL assignment is provided by PDCCH, and stored or cleared based on L1 signalling indicating SPS activation or deactivation.

RRC configures the following parameters when the SPS is configured:

* *cs-RNTI*: CS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;

* *nrofHARQ-Processes*: the number of configured HARQ processes for SPS;

* *harq-ProcID-Offset*: Offset of HARQ process for SPS;

* *periodicity*: periodicity of configured downlink assignment for SPS.

When the SPS is released by upper layers, all the corresponding configurations shall be released.

After a downlink assignment is configured for SPS, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that the Nth downlink assignment occurs in the slot for which:

(*numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × SFN + slot number in the frame) =
[(*numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × SFNstart time + slotstart time) + N × *periodicity* × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* / 10] modulo (1024 × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame*)

where SFNstart time and slotstart time are the SFN and slot, respectively, of the first transmission of PDSCH where the configured downlink assignment was (re-)initialised.

NOTE: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the occurrences of configured downlink assignments.

### 5.8.2 Uplink

There are two types of transmission without dynamic grant:

* configured grant Type 1 where an uplink grant is provided by RRC, and stored as configured uplink grant;

* configured grant Type 2 where an uplink grant is provided by PDCCH, and stored or cleared as configured uplink grant based on L1 signalling indicating configured uplink grant activation or deactivation.

Type 1 and Type 2 are configured by RRC for a Serving Cell per BWP. Multiple configurations can be active simultaneously in the same BWP. For Type 2, activation and deactivation are independent among the Serving Cells. For the same BWP, the MAC entity can be configured with both Type 1 and Type 2.

RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 1 is configured:

* *cs-RNTI*: CS-RNTI for retransmission;

* *periodicity*: periodicity of the configured grant Type 1;

* *timeDomainOffset*: Offset of a resource with respect to SFN = *timeReferenceSFN* in time domain;

* *timeDomainAllocation*: Allocation of configured uplink grant in time domain which contains *startSymbolAndLength* (i.e. *SLIV* in TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References)) or *startSymbol* (i.e. *S* in TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References));

* *nrofHARQ-Processes*: the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;

* *harq-ProcID-Offset*: offset of HARQ process for configured grant for operation with shared spectrum channel access;

* *harq-ProcID-Offset2*: offset of HARQ process for configured grant;

* *timeReferenceSFN*: SFN used for determination of the offset of a resource in time domain. The UE uses the closest SFN with the indicated number preceding the reception of the configured grant configuration.

RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 2 is configured:

* *cs-RNTI*: CS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;

* *periodicity*: periodicity of the configured grant Type 2;

* *nrofHARQ-Processes*: the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;

* *harq-ProcID-Offset*: offset of HARQ process for configured grant for operation with shared spectrum channel access;

* *harq-ProcID-Offset2*: offset of HARQ process for configured grant.

RRC configures the following parameters when retransmissions on configured uplink grant is configured:

* *cg-RetransmissionTimer*: the duration after a configured grant (re)transmission of a HARQ process when the UE shall not autonomously retransmit that HARQ process.

Upon configuration of a configured grant Type 1 for a BWP of a Serving Cell by upper layers, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> store the uplink grant provided by upper layers as a configured uplink grant for the indicated BWP of the Serving Cell;

- 1> initialise or re-initialise the configured uplink grant to start in the symbol according to *timeDomainOffset*, *timeReferenceSFN*, and *S* (derived from *SLIV* or provided by *startSymbol* as specified in TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References)), and to reoccur with *periodicity*.

After an uplink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 1, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that the Nth (N \>= 0) uplink grant occurs in the symbol for which:

[(SFN × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot*) + (slot number in the frame × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot*) + symbol number in the slot] =
(*timeReferenceSFN* × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot* *+* *timeDomainOffset* × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot* + *S* + N × *periodicity*) modulo (1024 × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot*).

After an uplink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that the Nth (N \>= 0) uplink grant occurs in the symbol for which:

[(SFN × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot*) + (slot number in the frame × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot*) + symbol number in the slot] =
[(SFNstart time × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot* + slotstart time × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot* + symbolstart time) + N × *periodicity*] modulo (1024 × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* × *numberOfSymbolsPerSlot*).

where SFNstart time, slotstart time, and symbolstart time are the SFN, slot, and symbol, respectively, of the first transmission opportunity of PUSCH where the configured uplink grant was (re-)initialised.

If *cg-nrofPUSCH-InSlot* or *cg-nrofSlots* is configured for a configured grant Type 1 or Type 2, the MAC entity shall consider the uplink grants occur in those additional PUSCH allocations as specified in clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References).

NOTE: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the occurrences of configured uplink grants.

When the configured uplink grant is released by upper layers, all the corresponding configurations shall be released and all corresponding uplink grants shall be cleared.

The MAC entity shall:

- 1> if at least one configured uplink grant confirmation has been triggered and not cancelled; and

- 1> if the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for new transmission:

    - 2> if, in this MAC entity, at least one configured uplink grant is configured by *configuredGrantConfigToAddModList*:

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Multiple Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.31.

    - 2> else:

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.7.

    - 2> cancel all triggered configured uplink grant confirmation(s).

For a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall clear the configured uplink grant(s) immediately after first transmission of Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE or Multiple Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE which confirms the configured uplink grant deactivation.

Retransmissions use:

* repetition of configured uplink grants; or

* received uplink grants addressed to CS-RNTI; or

* configured uplink grants with *cg-RetransmissionTimer* configured.

### 5.8.3 Sidelink

There are two types of transmission without dynamic sidelink grant:

* configured grant Type 1 where an sidelink grant is provided by RRC, and stored as configured sidelink grant;

* configured grant Type 2 where an sidelink grant is provided by PDCCH, and stored or cleared as configured sidelink grant based on L1 signalling indicating configured sidelink grant activation or deactivation.

Type 1 and/or Type 2 are configured with a single BWP. Multiple configurations of up to 8 configured grants (including both Type 1 and Type 2, if configured) can be active simultaneously on the BWP.

RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 1 is configured, as specified in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References) or TS 36.331 [[21]](#2-References):

* *sl-ConfigIndexCG*: the identifier of a configured grant for sidelink;

* *sl-CS-RNTI*: SLCS-RNTI for retransmission;

* *sl-NrOfHARQ-Processes*: the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;

* *sl-PeriodCG*: periodicity of the configured grant Type 1;

* *sl-TimeOffsetCG-Type1*: Offset of a resource with respect to reference logical slot defined by *sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Type1* in time domain, referring to the number of logical slots in a resource pool;

* *sl-TimeResourceCG-Type1*: time resource location of the configured grant Type 1;

* *sl-CG-MaxTransNumList*: the maximum number of times that a TB can be transmitted using the configured grant;

*- sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset*: offset of HARQ process for configured grant Type 1;

* *sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Type1*: SFN used for determination of the offset of a resource in time domain. If it is present, the UE uses the first logical slot of associated resource pool after the starting time of the closest SFN with the indicated number preceding the reception of the sidelink configured grant configuration Type 1 as reference logical slot. If it is absent, the indicated reference SFN is zero.

RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 2 is configured, as specified in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References):

* *sl-ConfigIndexCG*: the identifier of a configured grant for sidelink;

* *sl-CS-RNTI*: SLCS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;

* *sl-NrOfHARQ-Processes*: the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;

* *sl-PeriodCG*: periodicity of the configured grant Type 2;

* *sl-CG-MaxTransNumList*: the maximum number of times that a TB can be transmitted using the configured grant;

*- sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset*: offset of HARQ process for configured grant Type 2.

Upon configuration of a configured grant Type 1, the MAC entity shall for each configured sidelink grant:

- 1> store the sidelink grant provided by RRC as a configured sidelink grant;

- 1> initialise or re-initialise the configured sidelink grant to determine PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) according to *sl-TimeOffsetCG-Type1* and *sl-TimeResourceCG-Type1*, and to reoccur with *sl-periodCG* for transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs according to clause 8.1.2 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References).

NOTE 1: If the MAC entity is configured with multiple configured sidelink grants, collision among the configured sidelink grants may occur. How to handle the collision is left to UE implementation.

After a sidelink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 1, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that the first slot of the Sth sidelink grant occurs in the logical slot for which:

CURRENT_slot *=* *(sl-ReferenceSlotCG-Type1* *+* *sl-TimeOffsetCG-Type1* + S × *PeriodicitySL*) modulo T'max

where CURRENT_slot refers to current logical slot in the associated resource pool,$$\  p e r i o d i c i t y S L = \left\lceil \frac{{T '}_{\max} \ }{1 0 2 4 0 \  m s} \times s l \_ p e r i o d C G \right\rceil$$ and T'max is the number of slots that belongs to the associated resource pool as defined in clause 8 of TS 38.214[[7]](#2-References). *sl-ReferenceSlotCG-Type1* refers to reference logical slot defined by *sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Type1*.

After a sidelink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall consider sequentially that the first slot of Sth sidelink grant occurs in the logical slot for which:

CURRENT_slot = (*sl-StartSlotCG-Type2* + S × *PeriodicitySL*) modulo T'max

where *sl-StartSlotCG-Type2* refers to the logical slot of the first transmission opportunity of PSSCH where the configured sidelink grant was (re)initialised.

When a configured sidelink grant is released by RRC, all the corresponding configurations shall be released and all corresponding sidelink grants shall be cleared.

The MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the configured sidelink grant confirmation has been triggered and not cancelled; and

- 1> if the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for new transmission:

    - 2> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Sidelink Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.34;

    - 2> cancel the triggered configured sidelink grant confirmation.

For a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall clear the corresponding configured sidelink grant immediately after first transmission of Sidelink Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE triggered by the configured sidelink grant deactivation.

## 5.9 Activation/Deactivation of SCells

If the MAC entity is configured with one or more SCells, the network may activate and deactivate the configured SCells. Upon configuration of an SCell, the SCell is deactivated unless the parameter *sCellState* is set to *activated* for the SCell by upper layers.

The configured SCell(s) is activated and deactivated by:

* receiving the SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.10;

* configuring *sCellDeactivationTimer* timer per configured SCell (except the SCell configured with PUCCH, if any): the associated SCell is deactivated upon its expiry;

* configuring *sCellState* per configured SCell: if configured, the associated SCell is activated upon SCell configuration.

The MAC entity shall for each configured SCell:

- 1> if an SCell is configured with *sCellState* set to *activated* upon SCell configuration, or an SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received activating the SCell:

    - 2> if the SCell was deactivated prior to receiving this SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE; or

    - 2> if the SCell is configured with *sCellState* set to *activated* upon SCell configuration:

      - 3> if *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* is not set to dormant BWP:

        - 4> activate the SCell according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References) for MAC CE activation and according to the timing defined in TS 38.133 [[11]](#2-References) for direct SCell activation; i.e. apply normal SCell operation including:

          - 5> SRS transmissions on the SCell;

          - 5> CSI reporting for the SCell;

          - 5> PDCCH monitoring on the SCell;

          - 5> PDCCH monitoring for the SCell;

          - 5> PUCCH transmissions on the SCell, if configured.

      - 3> else (i.e. *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* is set to dormant BWP):

        - 4> stop the *bwp-InactivityTimer* of this Serving Cell, if running.

      - 3> activate the DL BWP and UL BWP indicated by *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* and *firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id* respectively.

    - 2> start or restart the *sCellDeactivationTimer* associated with the SCell according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References) for MAC CE activation and according to the timing defined in TS 38.133 [[11]](#2-References) for direct SCell activation;

    - 2> if the active DL BWP is not the dormant BWP:

      - 3> (re-)initialize any suspended configured uplink grants of configured grant Type 1 associated with this SCell according to the stored configuration, if any, and to start in the symbol according to rules in clause 5.8.2;

      - 3> trigger PHR according to clause 5.4.6.

- 1> else if an SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received deactivating the SCell; or

- 1> if the *sCellDeactivationTimer* associated with the activated SCell expires:

    - 2> stop the *sCellDeactivationTimer* associated with the SCell;

    - 2> stop the *bwp-InactivityTimer* associated with the SCell;

    - 2> deactivate any active BWP associated with the SCell;

    - 2> clear any configured downlink assignment and any configured uplink grant Type 2 associated with the SCell respectively;

    - 2> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting associated with the SCell;

    - 2> suspend any configured uplink grant Type 1 associated with the SCell;

    - 2> flush all HARQ buffers associated with the SCell;

    - 2> cancel, if any, triggered consistent LBT failure for the SCell.

- 1> if PDCCH on the activated SCell indicates an uplink grant or downlink assignment; or

- 1> if PDCCH on the Serving Cell scheduling the activated SCell indicates an uplink grant or a downlink assignment for the activated SCell; or

- 1> if a MAC PDU is transmitted in a configured uplink grant and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers; or

- 1> if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment:

    - 2> restart the *sCellDeactivationTimer* associated with the SCell.

HARQ feedback for the MAC PDU containing SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE shall not be impacted by PCell, PSCell and PUCCH SCell interruptions due to SCell activation/deactivation in TS 38.133 [[11]](#2-References).

When SCell is deactivated, the ongoing Random Access procedure on the SCell, if any, is aborted.

## 5.10 Activation/Deactivation of PDCP duplication

If one or more DRBs are configured with PDCP duplication, the network may activate and deactivate the PDCP duplication for all or a subset of associated RLC entities for the configured DRB(s).

The PDCP duplication for the configured DRB(s) is activated and deactivated by:

* receiving the Duplication Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.11;

* receiving the Duplication RLC Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.32;

## 5.15 Bandwidth Part (BWP) operation

### 5.15.1 Downlink and Uplink

In addition to clause 12 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References), this clause specifies requirements on BWP operation.

A Serving Cell may be configured with one or multiple BWPs, and the maximum number of BWP per Serving Cell is specified in TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References).

The BWP switching for a Serving Cell is used to activate an inactive BWP and deactivate an active BWP at a time. The BWP switching is controlled by the PDCCH indicating a downlink assignment or an uplink grant, by the *bwp-InactivityTimer*, by RRC signalling, or by the MAC entity itself upon initiation of Random Access procedure or upon detection of consistent LBT failure on SpCell. Upon RRC (re-)configuration of *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* and/or *firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id* for SpCell or activation of an SCell, the DL BWP and/or UL BWP indicated by *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* and/or *firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id* respectively (as specified in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References)) is active without receiving PDCCH indicating a downlink assignment or an uplink grant. The active BWP for a Serving Cell is indicated by either RRC or PDCCH (as specified in TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References)). For unpaired spectrum, a DL BWP is paired with a UL BWP, and BWP switching is common for both UL and DL.

For each SCell a dormant BWP may be configured with *dormantBWP-Id* by RRC signalling as described in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References). Entering or leaving dormant BWP for SCells is done by BWP switching per SCell or per dormancy SCell group based on instruction from PDCCH (as specified in TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References)). The dormancy SCell group configurations are configured by RRC signalling as described in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References). Upon reception of the PDCCH indicating leaving dormant BWP, the DL BWP indicated by *firstOutsideActiveTimeBWP-Id* or by *firstWithinActiveTimeBWP-Id* (as specified in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References) and TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References)) is activated. Upon reception of the PDCCH indicating entering dormant BWP, the DL BWP indicated by *dormantBWP-Id* (as specified in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References)) is activated. The dormant BWP configuration for SpCell or PUCCH SCell is not supported.

For each activated Serving Cell configured with a BWP, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if a BWP is activated and the active DL BWP for the Serving Cell is not the dormant BWP:

    - 2> transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;

    - 2> transmit on RACH on the BWP, if PRACH occasions are configured;

    - 2> monitor the PDCCH on the BWP;

    - 2> transmit PUCCH on the BWP, if configured;

    - 2> report CSI for the BWP;

    - 2> transmit SRS on the BWP, if configured;

    - 2> receive DL-SCH on the BWP;

    - 2> (re-)initialize any suspended configured uplink grants of configured grant Type 1 on the active BWP according to the stored configuration, if any, and to start in the symbol according to rules in clause 5.8.2;

    - 2> if *lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig* is configured:

      - 3> stop the *lbt-FailureDetectionTimer*, if running;

      - 3> set *LBT_COUNTER* to 0;

      - 3> monitor LBT failure indications from lower layers as specified in clause 5.21.2.

- 1> if a BWP is activated and the active DL BWP for the Serving Cell is dormant BWP:

    - 2> stop the *bwp-InactivityTimer* of this Serving Cell, if running.

    - 2> not monitor the PDCCH on the BWP;

    - 2> not monitor the PDCCH for the BWP;

    - 2> not receive DL-SCH on the BWP;

    - 2> not report CSI on the BWP, report CSI except aperiodic CSI for the BWP;

    - 2> not transmit SRS on the BWP;

    - 2> not transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;

    - 2> not transmit on RACH on the BWP;

    - 2> not transmit PUCCH on the BWP;

    - 2> clear any configured downlink assignment and any configured uplink grant Type 2 associated with the SCell respectively;

    - 2> suspend any configured uplink grant Type 1 associated with the SCell;

    - 2> if configured, perform beam failure detection and beam failure recovery for the SCell if beam failure is detected.

- 1> if a BWP is deactivated:

    - 2> not transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;

    - 2> not transmit on RACH on the BWP;

    - 2> not monitor the PDCCH on the BWP;

    - 2> not transmit PUCCH on the BWP;

    - 2> not report CSI for the BWP;

    - 2> not transmit SRS on the BWP;

    - 2> not receive DL-SCH on the BWP;

    - 2> clear any configured downlink assignment and configured uplink grant of configured grant Type 2 on the BWP;

    - 2> suspend any configured uplink grant of configured grant Type 1 on the inactive BWP.

Upon initiation of the Random Access procedure on a Serving Cell, after the selection of carrier for performing Random Access procedure as specified in clause 5.1.1, the MAC entity shall for the selected carrier of this Serving Cell:

- 1> if PRACH occasions are not configured for the active UL BWP:

    - 2> switch the active UL BWP to BWP indicated by *initialUplinkBWP*;

    - 2> if the Serving Cell is an SpCell:

      - 3> switch the active DL BWP to BWP indicated by *initialDownlinkBWP*.

- 1> else:

    - 2> if the Serving Cell is an SpCell:

      - 3> if the active DL BWP does not have the same *bwp-Id* as the active UL BWP:

        - 4> switch the active DL BWP to the DL BWP with the same *bwp-Id* as the active UL BWP.

- 1> stop the *bwp-InactivityTimer* associated with the active DL BWP of this Serving Cell, if running.

- 1> if the Serving Cell is SCell:

    - 2> stop the *bwp-InactivityTimer* associated with the active DL BWP of SpCell, if running.

- 1> perform the Random Access procedure on the active DL BWP of SpCell and active UL BWP of this Serving Cell.

If the MAC entity receives a PDCCH for BWP switching of a Serving Cell, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if there is no ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving Cell; or

- 1> if the ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving Cell is successfully completed upon reception of this PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI (as specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.4a, and 5.1.5):

    - 2> cancel, if any, triggered consistent LBT failure for this Serving Cell;

    - 2> perform BWP switching to a BWP indicated by the PDCCH.

If the MAC entity receives a PDCCH for BWP switching for a Serving Cell(s) or a dormancy SCell group(s) while a Random Access procedure associated with that Serving Cell is ongoing in the MAC entity, it is up to UE implementation whether to switch BWP or ignore the PDCCH for BWP switching, except for the PDCCH reception for BWP switching addressed to the C-RNTI for successful Random Access procedure completion (as specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.4a, and 5.1.5) in which case the UE shall perform BWP switching to a BWP indicated by the PDCCH. Upon reception of the PDCCH for BWP switching other than successful contention resolution, if the MAC entity decides to perform BWP switching, the MAC entity shall stop the ongoing Random Access procedure and initiate a Random Access procedure after performing the BWP switching; if the MAC decides to ignore the PDCCH for BWP switching, the MAC entity shall continue with the ongoing Random Access procedure on the Serving Cell.

Upon reception of RRC (re-)configuration for BWP switching for a Serving Cell while a Random Access procedure associated with that Serving Cell is ongoing in the MAC entity, the MAC entity shall stop the ongoing Random Access procedure and initiate a Random Access procedure after performing the BWP switching.

Upon reception of RRC (re-)configuration for BWP switching for a Serving Cell, cancel any triggered LBT failure in this Serving Cell.

The MAC entity shall for each activated Serving Cell configured with *bwp-InactivityTimer*:

- 1> if the *defaultDownlinkBWP-Id* is configured, and the active DL BWP is not the BWP indicated by the *defaultDownlinkBWP-Id*, and the active DL BWP is not the BWP indicated by the *dormantBWP-Id* if configured; or

- 1> if the *defaultDownlinkBWP-Id* is not configured, and the active DL BWP is not the *initialDownlinkBWP*, and the active DL BWP is not the BWP indicated by the *dormantBWP-Id* if configured:

    - 2> if a PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI or CS-RNTI indicating downlink assignment or uplink grant is received on the active BWP; or

    - 2> if a PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI or CS-RNTI indicating downlink assignment or uplink grant is received for the active BWP; or

    - 2> if a MAC PDU is transmitted in a configured uplink grant and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers; or

    - 2> if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment:

      - 3> if there is no ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving Cell; or

      - 3> if the ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving Cell is successfully completed upon reception of this PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI (as specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.4a and 5.1.5):

        - 4> start or restart the *bwp-InactivityTimer* associated with the active DL BWP.

    - 2> if the *bwp-InactivityTimer* associated with the active DL BWP expires:

      - 3> if the *defaultDownlinkBWP-Id* is configured:

        - 4> perform BWP switching to a BWP indicated by the *defaultDownlinkBWP-Id*.

      - 3> else:

        - 4> perform BWP switching to the *initialDownlinkBWP*.

NOTE: If a Random Access procedure is initiated on an SCell, both this SCell and the SpCell are associated with this Random Access procedure.

- 1> if a PDCCH for BWP switching is received, and the MAC entity switches the active DL BWP:

    - 2> if the *defaultDownlinkBWP-Id* is configured, and the MAC entity switches to the DL BWP which is not indicated by the *defaultDownlinkBWP-Id* and is not indicated by the *dormantBWP-Id* if configured; or

    - 2> if the *defaultDownlinkBWP-Id* is not configured, and the MAC entity switches to the DL BWP which is not the *initialDownlinkBWP* and is not indicated by the *dormantBWP-Id* if configured:

      - 3> start or restart the *bwp-InactivityTimer* associated with the active DL BWP.

### 5.15.2 Sidelink

In addition to clause 16 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References), this clause specifies requirements on BWP operation for sidelink.

The MAC entity is configured with at most a single SL BWP where sidelink transmission and reception are performed.

For a BWP, the MAC entity shall:

## 5.16 SUL operation

The Supplementary UL (SUL) carrier can be configured as a complement to the normal UL (NUL) carrier. Switching between the NUL carrier and the SUL carrier means that the UL transmissions move from one carrier to the other carrier, which is done by:

* an indication in DCI;

* the Random Access procedure as specified in clause 5.1.1.

If the MAC entity receives a UL grant indicating an SUL switch while a Random Access procedure is ongoing, the MAC entity shall ignore the UL grant.

The Serving Cell configured with *supplementaryUplink* belongs to a single TAG.

## 5.17 Beam Failure Detection and Recovery procedure

The MAC entity may be configured by RRC per Serving Cell with a beam failure recovery procedure which is used for indicating to the serving gNB of a new SSB or CSI-RS when beam failure is detected on the serving SSB(s)/CSI-RS(s). Beam failure is detected by counting beam failure instance indication from the lower layers to the MAC entity. If *beamFailureRecoveryConfig* is reconfigured by upper layers during an ongoing Random Access procedure for beam failure recovery for SpCell, the MAC entity shall stop the ongoing Random Access procedure and initiate a Random Access procedure using the new configuration.

RRC configures the following parameters in the *BeamFailureRecoveryConfig*, *BeamFailureRecoverySCellConfig*, and the *RadioLinkMonitoringConfig* for the Beam Failure Detection and Recovery procedure:

* *beamFailureInstanceMaxCount* for the beam failure detection;

* *scalingFactorBI*: *scalingFactorBI* for the SpCell beam failure recovery;

* *ssb-perRACH-Occasion*: *ssb-perRACH-Occasion* for the SpCell beam failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;

* *ra-ResponseWindow*: the time window to monitor response(s) for the SpCell beam failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;

* *prach-ConfigurationIndex*: *prach-ConfigurationIndex* for the SpCell beam failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;

* *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex*: *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* for the SpCell beam failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;

* *ra-OccasionList*: *ra-OccasionList* for the SpCell beam failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;

* *candidateBeamRSList*: list of candidate beams for SpCell beam failure recovery;

* *candidateBeamRSSCellList*: list of candidate beams for SCell beam failure recovery.

The following UE variables are used for the beam failure detection procedure:

* *BFI_COUNTER* (per Serving Cell): counter for beam failure instance indication which is initially set to 0.

The MAC entity shall for each Serving Cell configured for beam failure detection:

- 1> if beam failure instance indication has been received from lower layers:

    - 2> start or restart the *beamFailureDetectionTimer*;

    - 2> increment *BFI_COUNTER* by 1;

    - 2> if *BFI_COUNTER* \>= *beamFailureInstanceMaxCount*:

      - 3> if the Serving Cell is SCell:

        - 4> trigger a BFR for this Serving Cell;

      - 3> else:

        - 4> initiate a Random Access procedure (see clause 5.1) on the SpCell.

- 1> if the *beamFailureDetectionTimer* expires; or

- 1> if *beamFailureDetectionTimer*, *beamFailureInstanceMaxCount*, or any of the reference signals used for beam failure detection is reconfigured by upper layers associated with this Serving Cell:

    - 2> set *BFI_COUNTER* to 0.

- 1> if the Serving Cell is SpCell and the Random Access procedure initiated for SpCell beam failure recovery is successfully completed (see clause 5.1):

    - 2> set *BFI_COUNTER* to 0;

    - 2> stop the *beamFailureRecoveryTimer*, if configured;

    - 2> consider the Beam Failure Recovery procedure successfully completed.

- 1> else if the Serving Cell is SCell, and a PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI indicating uplink grant for a new transmission is received for the HARQ process used for the transmission of the BFR MAC CE or Truncated BFR MAC CE which contains beam failure recovery information of this Serving Cell; or

- 1> if the SCell is deactivated as specified in clause 5.9:

    - 2> set *BFI_COUNTER* to 0;

    - 2> consider the Beam Failure Recovery procedure successfully completed and cancel all the triggered BFRs for this Serving Cell.

The MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the Beam Failure Recovery procedure determines that at least one BFR has been triggered and not cancelled for an SCell for which evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [[11]](#2-References) has been completed:

    - 2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and if the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the BFR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of LCP:

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the BFR MAC CE.

    - 2> else if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and if the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the Truncated BFR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of LCP:

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the Truncated BFR MAC CE.

    - 2> else:

      - 3> trigger the SR for SCell beam failure recovery for each SCell for which BFR has been triggered, not cancelled, and for which evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [[11]](#2-References) has been completed.

All BFRs triggered for an SCell shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a BFR MAC CE or Truncated BFR MAC CE which contains beam failure information of that SCell.

## 5.21 LBT operation

### 5.21.1 General

The lower layer may perform an LBT procedure, see TS 37.213 [[18]](#2-References), according to which a transmission is not performed by lower layers if the channel is identified as being occupied. When lower layer performs an LBT procedure before a transmission and the transmission is not performed, an LBT failure indication is sent to the MAC entity from lower layers. Unless otherwise specified, when LBT procedure is performed for a transmission, actions as specified in this specification are performed regardless of if an LBT failure indication is received from lower layers. When LBT is not performed by the lower layers, LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers.

### 5.21.2 LBT failure detection and recovery procedure

The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a consistent LBT failure recovery procedure. Consistent LBT failure is detected per UL BWP by counting LBT failure indications, for all UL transmissions, from the lower layers to the MAC entity.

RRC configures the following parameters in the *lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig*:

* *lbt-FailureInstanceMaxCount* for the consistent LBT failure detection;

* *lbt-FailureDetectionTimer* for the consistent LBT failure detection;

The following UE variable is used for the consistent LBT failure detection procedure:

* *LBT_COUNTER* (per Serving Cell): counter for LBT failure indication which is initially set to 0.

For each activated Serving Cell configured with *lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig*, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if LBT failure indication has been received from lower layers:

    - 2> start or restart the *lbt-FailureDetectionTimer*;

    - 2> increment *LBT_COUNTER* by 1;

    - 2> if *LBT_COUNTER* \>= *lbt-FailureInstanceMaxCount*:

      - 3> trigger consistent LBT failure for the active UL BWP in this Serving Cell;

      - 3> if this Serving Cell is the SpCell:

        - 4> if consistent LBT failure has been triggered in all UL BWPs configured with PRACH occasions on same carrier in this Serving Cell:

          - 5> indicate consistent LBT failure to upper layers.

        - 4> else:

          - 5> stop any ongoing Random Access procedure in this Serving Cell;

          - 5> switch the active UL BWP to an UL BWP, on same carrier in this Serving Cell, configured with PRACH occasion and for which consistent LBT failure has not been triggered;

          - 5> initiate a Random Access Procedure (as specified in clause 5.1.1).

- 1> if all triggered consistent LBT failures are cancelled in this Serving Cell; or

- 1> if the *lbt-FailureDetectionTimer* expires; or

- 1> if *lbt-FailureDetectionTimer* or *lbt-FailureInstanceMaxCount* is reconfigured by upper layers:

    - 2> set *LBT_COUNTER* to 0.

The MAC entity shall:

- 1> if consistent LBT failure has been triggered, and not cancelled, in the SpCell; and

- 1> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission in the SpCell and these UL-SCH resources can accommodate the LBT failure MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:

    - 2> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the LBT failure MAC CE.

- 1> else if consistent LBT failure has been triggered, and not cancelled, in at least one SCell:

    - 2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission in a Serving Cell for which consistent LBT failure has not been triggered and these UL-SCH resources can accommodate the LBT failure MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the LBT failure MAC CE.

    - 2> else:

      - 3> trigger a Scheduling Request for LBT failure MAC CE.

- 1> if a MAC PDU is transmitted and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers and this PDU includes the LBT failure MAC CE:

    - 2> cancel all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) in SCell(s) for which consistent LBT failure was indicated in the transmitted LBT failure MAC CE.

- 1> if consistent LBT failure is triggered and not cancelled in the SpCell; and

- 1> if the Random Access procedure is considered successfully completed (see clause 5.1) in the SpCell:

    - 2> cancel all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) in the SpCell.

- 1> if *lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig* is reconfigured by upper layers for a Serving Cell:

    - 2> cancel all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) in this Serving Cell.

* a time required for PSFCH reception and processing plus sidelink retransmission preparation including multiplexing of necessary physical channels and any TX-RX/RX-TX switching time.

NOTE 4: How to determine the time required for PSFCH reception and processing plus sidelink retransmission preparation is left to UE implementation.

The MAC entity shall for each PSSCH duration:

- 1> for each sidelink grant occurring in this PSSCH duration:

    - 2> select a MCS table allowed in the pool of resource which is associated with the sidelink grant;

NOTE 4a: MCS table selection is up to UE implementation if more than one MCS table is configured.

    - 2> if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1:

      - 3> select a MCS which is, if configured, within the range that is configured by RRC between *sl-MinMCS-PSSCH* and *sl-MaxMCS-PSSCH* associated with the selected MCS table included in *sl-ConfigDedicatedNR*;

      - 3> set the resource reservation interval to 0ms.

    - 2> else:

      - 3> select a MCS which is, if configured, within the range that is configured by RRC between *sl-MinMCS-PSSCH* and *sl-MaxMCS-PSSCH* associated with the selected MCS table included in *sl-PSSCH-TxConfigList* and, if configured by RRC, overlapped between *sl-MinMCS-PSSCH* and *sl-MaxMCS-PSSCH* associated with the selected MCS table indicated in *sl-CBR-PriorityTxConfigList* for the highest priority of the sidelink logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU and the CBR measured by lower layers according to clause 5.1.27 of TS 38.215 [[24]](#2-References) if CBR measurement results are available or the corresponding *sl-defaultTxConfigIndex* configured by RRC if CBR measurement results are not available;

      - 3> if the MAC entity decides not to use the selected sidelink grant for the next PSSCH duration corresponding to an initial transmission opportunity:

        - 4> set the resource reservation interval to 0ms.

      - 3> else:

        - 4> set the resource reservation interval to the selected value.

NOTE 5: MCS selection is up to UE implementation if the MCS or the corresponding range is not configured by RRC.

    - 2> if the configured sidelink grant has been activated and this PSSCH duration corresponds to the first PSSCH transmission opportunity within this *sl-PeriodCG* of the configured sidelink grant:

      - 3> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PSSCH duration and, if available, all subsequent PSSCH duration(s) occuring in this *sl-PeriodCG* for the configured sidelink grant;

      - 3> determine that this PSSCH duration is used for initial transmission;

      - 3> flush the HARQ buffer of Sidelink process associated with the HARQ Process ID.

    - 2> deliver the sidelink grant, the selected MCS, and the associated HARQ information to the Sidelink HARQ Entity for this PSSCH duration.

For configured sidelink grants, the HARQ Process ID associated with the first slot of a SL transmission is derived from the following equation:

HARQ Process ID = [floor(CURRENT_slot / *PeriodicitySL*)] modulo *sl-NrOfHARQ-Processes* + *sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset*

where CURRENT_slot refers to current logical slot in the associated resource pool, and *PeriodicitySL* is defined in clause 5.8.3.

#### 5.22.1.2 TX resource (re-)selection check

If the TX resource (re-)selection check procedure is triggered on the selected pool of resources for a Sidelink process according to clause 5.22.1.1, the MAC entity shall for the Sidelink process:

- 1> if *SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER* = 0 and when *SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER* was equal to 1 the MAC entity randomly selected, with equal probability, a value in the interval [0, 1] which is above the probability configured by RRC in *sl-ProbResourceKeep*; or

- 1> if the pool of resources is configured or reconfigured by RRC; or

- 1> if there is no selected sidelink grant on the selected pool of resources; or

- 1> if neither transmission nor retransmission has been performed by the MAC entity on any resource indicated in the selected sidelink grant during the last second; or

- 1> if *sl-ReselectAfter* is configured and the number of consecutive unused transmission opportunities on resources indicated in the selected sidelink grant is equal to *sl-ReselectAfter*; or

- 1> if the selected sidelink grant cannot accommodate a RLC SDU by using the maximum allowed MCS configured by RRC in *sl-MaxMCS-PSSCH* associated with the selected MCS table and the UE selects not to segment the RLC SDU; or

NOTE 1: If the selected sidelink grant cannot accommodate the RLC SDU, it is left for UE implementation whether to perform segmentation or sidelink resource reselection.

- 1> if transmission(s) with the selected sidelink grant cannot fulfil the remaining PDB of the data in a logical channel according to the associated priority, and the MAC entity selects not to perform transmission(s) corresponding to a single MAC PDU:

NOTE 2: If the remaining PDB is not met, it is left for UE implementation whether to perform transmission(s) corresponding to single MAC PDU or sidelink resource reselection.

NOTE 3: It is left for UE implementation whether to trigger the TX resource (re-)selection due to the latency requirement of the MAC CE triggered according to clause 5.22.1.7.

    - 2> clear the selected sidelink grant associated to the Sidelink process, if available;

    - 2> trigger the TX resource (re-)selection.

NOTE 4: Void.

NOTE 5: Void.

#### 5.22.1.2a Re-evaluation and Pre-emption

A resource(s) of the selected sidelink grant for a MAC PDU to transmit from multiplexing and assembly entity is re-evaluated by physical layer at *T3* before the slot where the SCI indicating the resource(s) is signalled at first time as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References).

A resource(s) of the selected sidelink grant which has been indicated by a prior SCI for a MAC PDU to transmit from multiplexing and assembly entity could be checked for pre-emption by physical layer at *T3* before the slot where the resource(s) is located as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References).

NOTE 1: It is up to UE implementation to re-evaluate or pre-empt before 'm – *T3*' or after 'm – *T3*' but before 'm'. For re-evaluation, m is the slot where the SCI indicating the resource(s) is signalled at first time as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214. For pre-emption, m is the slot where the resource(s) is located as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214.

If the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2 to transmit using pool(s) of resources in a carrier as indicated in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References) or TS 36.331 [[21]](#2-References) based on sensing or random selection the MAC entity shall for each Sidelink process:

- 1> if a resource(s) of the selected sidelink grant which has not been identified by a prior SCI is indicated for re-evaluation by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References); or

- 1> if any resource(s) of the selected sidelink grant which has been indicated by a prior SCI is indicated for pre-emption by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References):

    - 2> remove the resource(s) from the selected sidelink grant associated to the Sidelink process;

    - 2> randomly select the time and frequency resource from the resources indicated by the physical layer as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References) for either the removed resource or the dropped resource, according to the amount of selected frequency resources, the selected number of HARQ retransmissions and the remaining PDB of either SL data available in the logical channel(s) by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected resources of the selected sidelink grant in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of resources, and that a resource can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a SCI for a retransmission according to clause 8.3.1.1 of TS 38.212 [[9]](#2-References);

NOTE 2: If retransmission resource(s) cannot be selected by ensuring that the resource(s) can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior SCI, how to select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission opportunities from the available resources is left for UE implementation by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected ‎resources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of ‎resources.

    - 2> replace the removed or dropped resource(s) by the selected resource(s) for the selected sidelink grant.

NOTE 3: It is left for UE implementation to reselect any pre-selected but not reserved resource(s) during reselection triggered by re-evaluation or pre-emption indicated by the physical layer.

NOTE 4: It is up to UE implementation whether to set the resource reservation interval in the re-selected resource to replace pre-empted resource.

NOTE 5: It is up to UE implementation whether to trigger resource reselection due to deprioritization as specified in clause 16.2.4 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References), clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References) and clause 5.22.1.3.1a.

NOTE 6: For the selected sidelink grant corresponds to transmissions of multiple MAC PDU, it is up to UE implementation whether to apply re-evaluation check to the resources in non-initial reservation period that have been signalled neither in the immediate last nor in the current period.

#### 5.22.1.3 Sidelink HARQ operation

##### 5.22.1.3.1 Sidelink HARQ Entity

The MAC entity includes at most one Sidelink HARQ entity for transmission on SL-SCH, which maintains a number of parallel Sidelink processes.

The maximum number of transmitting Sidelink processes associated with the Sidelink HARQ Entity is 16. A sidelink process may be configured for transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs. For transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2, the maximum number of transmitting Sidelink processes associated with the Sidelink HARQ Entity is 4.

A delivered sidelink grant and its associated Sidelink transmission information are associated with a Sidelink process. Each Sidelink process supports one TB.

      - 3> identify the Sidelink process associated with this grant, and for the associated Sidelink process:

        - 4> deliver the sidelink grant of the MAC PDU to the associated Sidelink process;

        - 4> instruct the associated Sidelink process to trigger a retransmission.

##### 5.22.1.3.1a Sidelink process

The Sidelink process is associated with a HARQ buffer.

New transmissions and retransmissions are performed on the resource indicated in the sidelink grant as specified in clause 5.22.1.1 and with the MCS selected as specified in clause 8.1.3.1 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References) and clause 5.22.1.1.

If the Sidelink process is configured to perform transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2, the process maintains a counter *SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER*. For other configurations of the Sidelink process, this counter is not available.

Priority of a MAC PDU is determined by the highest priority of the logical channel(s) or a MAC CE in the MAC PDU.

If the Sidelink HARQ Entity requests a new transmission, the Sidelink process shall:

- 1> store the MAC PDU in the associated HARQ buffer;

- 1> store the sidelink grant received from the Sidelink HARQ Entity;

- 1> generate a transmission as described below.

If the Sidelink HARQ Entity requests a retransmission, the Sidelink process shall:

- 1> store the sidelink grant received from the Sidelink HARQ Entity;

- 1> generate a transmission as described below.

To generate a transmission, the Sidelink process shall:

- 1> if there is no uplink transmission; or

- 1> if the MAC entity is able to simultaneously perform uplink transmission(s) and sidelink transmission at the time of the transmission; or

- 1> if the other MAC entity and the MAC entity are able to simultaneously perform uplink transmission(s) and sidelink transmission at the time of the transmission respectively; or

- 1> if there is a MAC PDU to be transmitted for this duration in uplink, except a MAC PDU obtained from the Msg3 buffer, the MSGA buffer, or prioritized as specified in clause 5.4.2.2, and the sidelink transmission is prioritized over uplink transmission:

    - 2> instruct the physical layer to transmit SCI according to the stored sidelink grant with the associated Sidelink transmission information;

    - 2> instruct the physical layer to generate a transmission according to the stored sidelink grant;

    - 2> if HARQ feedback has been enabled the MAC PDU according to clause 5.22.1.4.2:

      - 3> instruct the physical layer to monitor PSFCH for the transmission and perform PSFCH reception as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.2.

    - 2> if *sl-PUCCH-Config* is configured by RRC for the stored sidelink grant:

      - 3> determine transmission of an acknowledgement on the PUCCH as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.2.

- 1> if this transmission corresponds to the last transmission of the MAC PDU:

    - 2> decrement *SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER* by 1, if available.

NOTE 1: If the number of HARQ retransmissions selected by the MAC entity has been reached, or if a positive acknowledgement to a transmission of the MAC PDU has been received, or if a negative-only acknowledgement was enabled in the SCI and no negative acknowledgement was received for the transmission of the MAC PDU, the MAC entity determines this transmission corresponds to the last transmission of the MAC PDU for Sidelink resource allocation mode 2. How to determine the last transmission in other cases is up to UE implementation.

- 1> if *sl-MaxTransNum* corresponding to the highest priority of the logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU has been configured in *sl-CG-MaxTransNumList* for the sidelink grant by RRC and the number of transmissions of the MAC PDU has been reached to *sl-MaxTransNum*; or

- 1> if a positive acknowledgement to this transmission of the MAC PDU was received according to clause 5.22.1.3.2; or

- 1> if negative-only acknowledgement was enabled in the SCI and no negative acknowledgement was received for this transmission of the MAC PDU according to clause 5.22.1.3.2:

    - 2> flush the HARQ buffer of the associated Sidelink process.

The transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over uplink transmissions of the MAC entity or the other MAC entity if the following conditions are met:

- 1> if the MAC entity is not able to perform this sidelink transmission simultaneously with all uplink transmissions at the time of the transmission, and

- 1> if uplink transmission is neither prioritized as specified in clause 5.4.2.2 nor prioritized by upper layer according to TS 23.287 [[19]](#2-References); and

- 1> if *sl-PrioritizationThres* is configured and if the value of the highest priority of logical channel(s) or a MAC CE in the MAC PDU is lower than *sl-PrioritizationThres*.

NOTE 2: If the MAC entity is not able to perform this sidelink transmission simultaneously with all uplink transmissions as specified in clause 5.4.2.2 of TS 36.321 [[22]](#2-References) at the time of the transmission, and prioritization-related information is not available prior to the time of this sidelink transmission due to processing time restriction, it is up to UE implementation whether this sidelink transmission is performed.

##### 5.22.1.3.2 PSFCH reception

The MAC entity shall for each PSSCH transmission:

- 1> if an acknowledgement corresponding to the PSSCH transmission in clause 5.22.1.3.1a is obtained from the physical layer:

    - 2> deliver the acknowledgement to the corresponding Sidelink HARQ entity for the Sidelink process;

- 1> else:

    - 2> deliver a negative acknowledgement to the corresponding Sidelink HARQ entity for the Sidelink process;

- 1> if the PSSCH transmission occurs for a pair of Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC connection which has been established by upper layers:

    - 2> perform the HARQ-Based Sidelink RLF Detection procedure as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.3.

If *sl-PUCCH-Config* is configured by RRC, the MAC entity shall for a PUCCH transmission occasion:

- 1> if the *timeAlignmentTimer*, associated with the TAG containing the Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped or expired:

    - 2> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in this TB.

- 1> else if a MAC PDU has been obtained for a sidelink grant associated to the PUCCH transmission occasion in clause 5.22.1.3.1, the MAC entity shall:

    - 2> if the most recent transmission of the MAC PDU was not prioritized as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a:

      - 3> instruct the physical layer to signal a negative acknowledgement on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References).

    - 2> else if HARQ feedback has been disabled for the MAC PDU and next retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU is not required:

      - 3> instruct the physical layer to signal a positive acknowledgement corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References).

    - 2> else if HARQ feedback has been disabled for the MAC PDU and no sidelink grant is available for next retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU, if any:

      - 3> instruct the physical layer to signal a negative acknowledgement corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References).

    - 2> else:

      - 3> instruct the physical layer to signal an acknowledgement corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References)

- 1> else:

    - 2> instruct the physical layer to signal a positive acknowledgement on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References).

##### 5.22.1.3.3 HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection

The HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection procedure is used to detect Sidelink RLF based on a number of consecutive DTX on PSFCH reception occasions for a PC5-RRC connection.

RRC configures the following parameter to control HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection:

* *sl-maxNumConsecutiveDTX*.

The following UE variable is used for HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection.

* *numConsecutiveDTX*, which is maintained for each PC5-RRC connection.

The Sidelink HARQ Entity shall (re-)initialize *numConsecutiveDTX* to zero for each PC5-RRC connection which has been established by upper layers, if any, upon establishment of the PC5-RRC connection or (re)configuration of *sl-maxNumConsecutiveDTX*.

The Sidelink HARQ Entity shall for each PSFCH reception occasion associated to the PSSCH transmission:

- 1> if PSFCH reception is absent on the PSFCH reception occasion:

    - 2> increment *numConsecutiveDTX* by 1;

    - 2> if *numConsecutiveDTX* reaches *sl-maxNumConsecutiveDTX*:

      - 3> indicate HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection to RRC.

- 1> else:

    - 2> re-initialize *numConsecutiveDTX* to zero.

#### 5.22.1.4 Multiplexing and assembly

For PDU(s) associated with one SCI, MAC shall consider only logical channels with the same Source Layer-2 ID-Destination Layer-2 ID pair for one of unicast, groupcast and broadcast which is associated with the pair. Multiple transmissions for different Sidelink processes are allowed to be independently performed in different PSSCH durations.

##### 5.22.1.4.1 Logical channel prioritization

###### 5.22.1.4.1.1 General

The sidelink Logical Channel Prioritization procedure is applied whenever a new transmission is performed.

RRC controls the scheduling of sidelink data by signalling for each logical channel:

* *sl-Priority* where an increasing priority value indicates a lower priority level;

* *sl-PrioritisedBitRate* which sets the sidelink Prioritized Bit Rate (sPBR);

* *sl-BucketSizeDuration* which sets the sidelink Bucket Size Duration (sBSD).

RRC additionally controls the LCP procedure by configuring mapping restrictions for each logical channel:

* *sl-configuredGrantType1Allowed* which sets whether a configured grant Type 1 can be used for sidelink transmission;

* *sl-AllowedCG-List* which sets the allowed configured grant(s) for sidelink transmission;

* *sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled* which sets whether the logical channel is allowed to be multiplexed with logical channel(s) with *sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled* set to *enabled* or *disabled*.

The following UE variable is used for the Logical channel prioritization procedure:

* *SBj* which is maintained for each logical channel *j*.

The MAC entity shall initialize *SBj* of the logical channel to zero when the logical channel is established.

For each logical channel *j*, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> increment *SBj* by the product sPBR × T before every instance of the LCP procedure, where T is the time elapsed since *SBj* was last incremented;

- 1> if the value of *SBj* is greater than the sidelink bucket size (i.e. sPBR × sBSD):

    - 2> set *SBj* to the sidelink bucket size.

NOTE: The exact moment(s) when the UE updates *SBj* between LCP procedures is up to UE implementation, as long as *SBj* is up to date at the time when a grant is processed by LCP.

###### 5.22.1.4.1.2 Selection of logical channels

The MAC entity shall for each SCI corresponding to a new transmission:

- 1> select a Destination associated to one of unicast, groupcast and broadcast, having at least one of the MAC CE and the logical channel with the highest priority, among the logical channels that satisfy all the following conditions and MAC CE(s), if any, for the SL grant associated to the SCI:

    - 2> SL data is available for transmission; and

    - 2> *SBj* \> 0, in case there is any logical channel having *SBj* \> 0; and

    - 2> *sl-configuredGrantType1Allowed*, if configured, is set to *true* in case the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and

    - 2> *sl-AllowedCG-List*, if configured, includes the configured grant index associated to the SL grant; and

    - 2> *sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled* is set to *disabled*, if PSFCH is not configured for the SL grant associated to the SCI.

NOTE 1: If multiple Destinations have the logical channels satisfying all conditions above with the same highest priority or if multiple Destinations have either the MAC CE and/or the logical channels satisfying all conditions above with the same priority as the MAC CE, which Destination is selected among them is up to UE implementation.

- 1> select the logical channels satisfying all the following conditions among the logical channels belonging to the selected Destination:

    - 2> SL data is available for transmission; and

    - 2> *sl-configuredGrantType1Allowed*, if configured, is set to *true* in case the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and.

    - 2> *sl-AllowedCG-List*, if configured, includes the configured grant index associated to the SL grant; and

      - 3> if PSFCH is configured for the sidelink grant associated to the SCI:

        - 4> *sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled* is set to *enabled*, if *sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled* is set to *enabled* for the highest priority logical channel satisfying the above conditions; or

        - 4> *sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled* is set to *disabled*, if *sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled* is set to *disabled* for the highest priority logical channel satisfying the above conditions.

      - 3> else:

        - 4> sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled is set to disabled.

NOTE 2: *sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled* is set to disabled for the transmission of a MAC PDU only carrying CSI reporting MAC CE.

###### 5.22.1.4.1.3 Allocation of sidelink resources

The MAC entity shall for each SCI corresponding to a new transmission:

- 1> allocate resources to the logical channels as follows:

    - 2> logical channels selected in clause 5.22.1.4.1.2 for the SL grant with *SBj* \> 0 are allocated resources in a decreasing priority order. If the sPBR of a logical channel is set to *infinity*, the MAC entity shall allocate resources for all the data that is available for transmission on the logical channel before meeting the sPBR of the lower priority logical channel(s);

    - 2> decrement *SBj* by the total size of MAC SDUs served to logical channel *j* above;

    - 2> if any resources remain, all the logical channels selected in clause 5.22.1.4.1.2 are served in a strict decreasing priority order (regardless of the value of *SBj*) until either the data for that logical channel or the SL grant is exhausted, whichever comes first. Logical channels configured with equal priority should be served equally.

NOTE: The value of *SBj* can be negative.

The UE shall also follow the rules below during the SL scheduling procedures above:

* the UE should not segment an RLC SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or retransmitted RLC PDU) if the whole SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or retransmitted RLC PDU) fits into the remaining resources of the associated MAC entity;

* if the UE segments an RLC SDU from the logical channel, it shall maximize the size of the segment to fill the grant of the associated MAC entity as much as possible;

* the UE should maximise the transmission of data;

* if the MAC entity is given a sidelink grant size that is equal to or larger than 12 bytes while having data available and allowed (according to clause 5.22.1.4.1) for transmission, the MAC entity shall not transmit only padding;

* A logical channel configured with *sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled* set to *enabled* and a logical channel configured with *sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled* set to *disabled* cannot be multiplexed into the same MAC PDU.

The MAC entity shall not generate a MAC PDU for the HARQ entity if the following conditions are satisfied:

* there is no Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE generated for this PSSCH transmission as specified in clause 5.22.1.7; and

* the MAC PDU includes zero MAC SDUs.

Logical channels shall be prioritised in accordance with the following order (highest priority listed first):

* data from SCCH;

* Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE;

* data from any STCH.

##### 5.22.1.4.2 Multiplexing of MAC Control Elements and MAC SDUs

The MAC entity shall multiplex a MAC CE and MAC SDUs in a MAC PDU according to clauses 5.22.1.4.1 and 6.1.6.

#### 5.22.1.5 Scheduling Request

In addition to clause 5.4.4, the Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for requesting SL-SCH resources for new transmission when triggered by the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) or the SL-CSI reporting (clause 5.22.1.7). If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause 5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL BWP.

The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered the Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) (if such a configuration exists) is also considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR (clause 5.4.4). The value of the priority of the triggered SR corresponds to the value of priority of the logical channel that triggered the SR.

Each sidelink logical channel may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured by RRC. If the SL-CSI reporting procedure is enabled by RRC, the SL-CSI reporting is mapped to one SR configuration for all PC5-RRC connections. The SR configuration of the SL-CSI reporting triggered according to 5.22.1.7 is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR (clause 5.4.4). The value of the priority of the triggered SR corresponds to the value of the priority of the Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE.

All pending SR(s) triggered according to the Sidelink BSR procedure (clause 5.22.1.6) prior to the MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled and each respective *sr-ProhibitTimer* shall be stopped when the MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered a Sidelink BSR (see clause 5.22.1.4) prior to the MAC PDU assembly.

All pending SR(s) triggered according to the Sidelink BSR procedure (clause 5.22.1.6) shall be cancelled and each respective *sr-ProhibitTimer* shall be stopped when the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission in sidelink.

The pending SR triggered according to the SL-CSI reporting for a destination shall be cancelled and each respective *sr-ProhibitTimer* shall be stopped when the SL grant(s) can accommodate the Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE when the SL-CSI reporting that has been triggered but not cancelled or when the triggered SL-CSI reporting is cancelled due to latency non-fulfilment as specified in 5.22.1.7. All pending SR(s) triggered by either Sidelink BSR or Sidelink CSI report shall be cancelled, when RRC configures Sidelink resource allocation mode 2.

#### 5.22.1.6 Buffer Status Reporting

The Sidelink Buffer Status reporting (SL-BSR) procedure is used to provide the serving gNB with information about SL data volume in the MAC entity.

RRC configures the following parameters to control the SL-BSR:

* *sl-periodicBSR-Timer*, configured by *periodicBSR-Timer* in *sl-BSR-Config*;

* *sl-retxBSR-Timer*, configured by *retxBSR-Timer* in *sl-BSR-Config*;

* *sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied*;

* *sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer*, configured by *logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer* in *sl-BSR-Config*;

* *sl-logicalChannelGroup*.

Each logical channel which belongs to a Destination is allocated to an LCG as specified in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References). The maximum number of LCGs is eight.

The MAC entity determines the amount of SL data available for a logical channel according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [[3]](#2-References) and 38.323 [[4]](#2-References).

A SL-BSR shall be triggered if any of the following events occur:

- 1> if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1:

    - 2> SL data, for a logical channel of a Destination, becomes available to the MAC entity; and either

      - 3> this SL data belongs to a logical channel with higher priority than the priorities of the logical channels containing available SL data which belong to any LCG belonging to the same Destination; or

      - 3> none of the logical channels which belong to an LCG belonging to the same Destination contains any available SL data.

in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to as 'Regular SL-BSR';

    - 2> UL resources are allocated and number of padding bits remaining after a Padding BSR has been triggered is equal to or larger than the size of the SL-BSR MAC CE plus its subheader, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to as 'Padding SL-BSR';

    - 2> *sl-retxBSR-Timer* expires, and at least one of the logical channels which belong to an LCG contains SL data, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to as 'Regular SL-BSR';

    - 2> *sl-periodicBSR-Timer* expires, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to as 'Periodic SL-BSR'.

- 1> else:

    - 2> Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 is configured by RRC and SL data is available for transmission in the RLC entity or in the PDCP entity, in which case the Sidelink BSR is referred below to as "Regular SL-BSR".

For Regular SL-BSR, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the SL-BSR is triggered for a logical channel for which *sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied* with value *true* is configured by RRC:

    - 2> start or restart the *sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer*.

- 1> else:

    - 2> if running, stop the *sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer*.

For Regular and Periodic SL-BSR, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> if *sl-PrioritizationThres* is configured and the value of the highest priority of the logical channels that belong to any LCG and contain SL data for any Destination is lower than *sl-PrioritizationThres*; and

- 1> if *ul-PrioritizationThres* is configured and the value of the highest priority of the logical channels that belong to any LCG and contain UL data is equal to or higher than *ul-PrioritizationThres* according to clause 5.4.5:

    - 2> prioritize the LCG(s) for the Destination(s).

- 1> if the Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least one BSR has been triggered and not cancelled according to clause 5.4.5 and the UL grant cannot accommodate a SL-BSR MAC CE containing buffer status only for all prioritized LCGs having data available for transmission plus the subheader of the SL-BSR according to clause 5.4.3.1.3, in case the SL-BSR is considered as not prioritized:

    - 2> prioritize the SL-BSR for logical channel prioritization specified in clause 5.4.3.1;

    - 2> report Truncated SL-BSR containing buffer status for as many prioritized LCGs having data available for transmission as possible, taking the number of bits in the UL grant into consideration.

- 1> else if the number of bits in the UL grant is expected to be equal to or larger than the size of a SL-BSR containing buffer status for all LCGs having data available for transmission plus the subheader of the SL-BSR according to clause 5.4.3.1.3:

    - 2> report SL-BSR containing buffer status for all LCGs having data available for transmission.

- 1> else:

    - 2> report Truncated SL-BSR containing buffer status for as many LCGs having data available for transmission as possible, taking the number of bits in the UL grant into consideration.

For Padding BSR:

- 1> if the number of padding bits remaining after a Padding BSR has been triggered is equal to or larger than the size of a SL-BSR containing buffer status for all LCGs having data available for transmission plus its subheader:

    - 2> report SL-BSR containing buffer status for all LCGs having data available for transmission;

- 1> else:

    - 2> report Truncated SL-BSR containing buffer status for as many LCGs having data available for transmission as possible, taking the number of bits in the UL grant into consideration.

For SL-BSR triggered by *sl-retxBSR-Timer* expiry, the MAC entity considers that the logical channel that triggered the SL-BSR is the highest priority logical channel that has data available for transmission at the time the SL-BSR is triggered.

The MAC entity shall:

- 1> if the sidelink Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least one SL-BSR has been triggered and not cancelled:

    - 2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH resources can accommodate the SL-BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization according to clause 5.4.3.1:

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure in clause 5.4.3 to generate the SL-BSR MAC CE(s);

      - 3> start or restart *sl-periodicBSR-Timer* except when all the generated SL-BSRs are Truncated SL-BSRs;

      - 3> start or restart *sl-retxBSR-Timer*.

    - 2> if a Regular SL-BSR has been triggered and *sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer* is not running:

      - 3> if there is no UL-SCH resource available for a new transmission; or

      - 3> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH resources cannot accommodate the SL-BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization according to clause 5.4.3.1; or

      - 3> if the set of Subcarrier Spacing index values in *sl-AllowedSCS-List*, if configured for the logical channel that triggered the SL-BSR, does not include the Subcarrier Spacing index associated to the UL-SCH resources available for a new transmission; or

      - 3> if *sl-MaxPUSCH-Duration*, if configured for the logical channel that triggered the SL-BSR, is smaller than the PUSCH transmission duration associated to the UL-SCH resources available for a new transmission:

        - 4> trigger a Scheduling Request.

NOTE 1: UL-SCH resources are considered available if the MAC entity has been configured with, receives, or determines an uplink grant. If the MAC entity has determined at a given point in time that UL-SCH resources are available, this need not imply that UL-SCH resources are available for use at that point in time.

A MAC PDU shall contain at most one SL-BSR MAC CE, even when multiple events have triggered a SL-BSR. The Regular SL-BSR and the Periodic SL-BSR shall have precedence over the padding SL-BSR.

The MAC entity shall restart *sl-retxBSR-Timer* upon reception of an SL grant for transmission of new data on any SL-SCH.

All triggered SL-BSRs may be cancelled when the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for transmission. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered a SL-BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly. All triggered SL-BSRs shall be cancelled, and *sl-retx-BSR-Timer* and *sl-periodic-BSR-Timer* shall be stopped, when RRC configures Sidelink resource allocation mode 2.

NOTE 2: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. SL-BSR and SR can be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains a SL-BSR MAC CE, but before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, SL-BSR and SR can be triggered during MAC PDU assembly.

#### 5.22.1.7 CSI Reporting

The Sidelink Channel State Information (SL-CSI) reporting procedure is used to provide a peer UE with sidelink channel state information as specified in clause 8.5 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References).

RRC configures the following parameters to control the SL-CSI reporting procedure:

* *sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report*, which is maintained for each PC5-RRC connection.

The MAC entity maintains a *sl-CSI-ReportTimer* for each pair of the Source Layer-2 ID and the Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC connection. *sl-CSI-ReportTimer* is used for a SL-CSI reporting UE to follow the latency requirement signalled from a CSI triggering UE. The value of *sl-CSI-ReportTimer* is the same as the latency requirement of the SL-CSI reporting in *sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report* configured by RRC.

The MAC entity shall for each pair of the Source Layer-2 ID and the Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC connection which has been established by upper layers:

- 1> if the SL-CSI reporting has been triggered by a SCI and not cancelled:

    - 2> if the *sl-CSI-ReportTimer* for the triggered SL-CSI reporting is not running:

      - 3> start the *sl-CSI-ReportTimer*.

    - 2> if the *sl-CSI-ReportTimer* for the triggered SL-CSI reporting expires:

      - 3> cancel the triggered SL-CSI reporting.

    - 2> else if the MAC entity has SL resources allocated for new transmission and the SL-SCH resources can accommodate the SL-CSI reporting MAC CE and its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:

      - 3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.35;

      - 3> stop the *sl-CSI-ReportTimer* for the triggered SL-CSI reporting;

      - 3> cancel the triggered SL-CSI reporting.

    - 2> else if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1:

      - 3> trigger a Scheduling Request.

NOTE: The MAC entity configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 may trigger a Scheduling Request if transmission of a pending SL-CSI reporting with the sidelink grant(s) cannot fulfil the latency requirement associated to the SL-CSI reporting.

### 5.22.2 SL-SCH Data reception

#### 5.22.2.1 SCI reception

SCI indicate if there is a transmission on SL-SCH and provide the relevant HARQ information. A SCI consists of two parts: the 1st stage SCI on PSCCH and the 2nd stage SCI on PSSCH as specified in clause 8.1 of TS 38.214 [[7]](#2-References).

The MAC entity shall:

- 1> for each PSCCH duration during which the MAC entity monitors PSCCH:

    - 2> if a 1st stage SCI has been received on the PSCCH:

      - 3> determine the set of PSSCH durations in which reception of a 2nd stage SCI and the transport block occur using the received part of the SCI;

      - 3> if the 2nd stage SCI for this PSSCH duration has been received on the PSSCH:

        - 4> store the SCI as a valid SCI for the PSSCH durations corresponding to transmission(s) of the transport block and the associated HARQ information and QoS information;

- 1> for each PSSCH duration for which the MAC entity has a valid SCI:

    - 2> deliver the SCI and the associated Sidelink transmission information to the Sidelink HARQ Entity.

#### 5.22.2.2 Sidelink HARQ operation

##### 5.22.2.2.1 Sidelink HARQ Entity

There is at most one Sidelink HARQ Entity at the MAC entity for reception of the SL-SCH, which maintains a number of parallel Sidelink processes.

Each Sidelink process is associated with SCI in which the MAC entity is interested. This interest is determined by the Sidelink identification information of the SCI. The Sidelink HARQ Entity directs Sidelink transmission information and associated TBs received on the SL-SCH to the corresponding Sidelink processes.

The number of Receiving Sidelink processes associated with the Sidelink HARQ Entity is defined in TS 38.306 [[5]](#2-References).

For each PSSCH duration, the Sidelink HARQ Entity shall:

- 1> for each SCI valid for this PSSCH duration:

    - 2> if the NDI has been toggled compared to the value of the previous received transmission corresponding to the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI or this is the very first received transmission for the pair of the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI:

      - 3> if there is a Sidelink process associated with the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI:

        - 4> consider the Sidelink process as unoccupied;

        - 4> flush the soft buffer for the Sidelink process.

      - 3> allocate the TB received from the physical layer and the associated Sidelink identification information and Sidelink process ID to an unoccupied Sidelink process;

      - 3> associate the Sidelink process with the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink process ID of this SCI and consider this transmission to be a new transmission.

NOTE 1: When a new TB arrives, the Sidelink HARQ Entity allocates the TB to any unoccupied Sidelink process. If there is no unoccupied Sidelink process in the Sidelink HARQ entity, how to manage receiving Sidelink processes is up to UE implementation.

NOTE 1a: If the NDI has not been toggled compared to the value of the previous received transmission corresponding to the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI, and if there is no Sidelink process associated with the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI, it is up to UE implementation to handle the corresponding TB.

- 1> for each Sidelink process:

    - 2> if the NDI has not been toggled compared to the value of the previous received transmission corresponding to the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI for the Sidelink process according to its associated SCI:

      - 3> allocate the TB received from the physical layer to the Sidelink process and consider this transmission to be a retransmission.

NOTE 2: A single sidelink process can only be (re-)associated to a single combination of Sidelink identification information and Sidelink process ID at a time and a single combination of Sidelink identification information and Sidelink process ID can only be (re-)associated to a single sidelink process at a time.

##### 5.22.2.2.2 Sidelink process

For each PSSCH duration where a transmission takes place for the Sidelink process, one TB and the associated HARQ information is received from the Sidelink HARQ Entity.

For each received TB and associated Sidelink transmission information, the Sidelink process shall:

- 1> if this is a new transmission:

    - 2> attempt to decode the received data.

- 1> else if this is a retransmission:

    - 2> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:

      - 3> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the data currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the combined data.

- 1> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was successfully decoded for this TB; or

- 1> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:

    - 2> if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this TB:

      - 3> if this TB is associated to unicast, the DST field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of any of the Source Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to the Destination ID in the corresponding SCI, and the SRC field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 16 MSB of any of the Destination Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 8 LSB are equal to the Source ID in the corresponding SCI; or

      - 3> if this TB is associated to groupcast or broadcast and the DST field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of any of the Destination Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to the Destination ID in the corresponding SCI:

        - 4> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing entity;

    - 2> consider the Sidelink process as unoccupied.

- 1> else:

    - 2> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer for this TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.

- 1> if HARQ feedback is enabled by the SCI:

    - 2> if negative-only acknowledgement is indicated by the SCI according to clause 8.4.1 of TS 38.212 [[9]](#2-References):

      - 3> if UE's location information is available and distance beteween UE's location and the central location of the nearest zone that is calculated based on the *Zone_id* in the SCI and the value of *sl-ZoneLength* corresponding to the communication range requirement in the SCI as specified in TS 38.331 [[5]](#2-References) is smaller or equal to the communication range requirement in the SCI; or

      - 3> if none of *Zone_id* and communication range requirement is indicated by the SCI; or

      - 3> if UE's location information is not available:

        - 4> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was not successfully decoded for this TB and the data for this TB was not successfully decoded before:

          - 5> instruct the physical layer to generate a negative acknowledgement of the data in this TB.

    - 2> if negative-positive acknowledgement or unicast is indicated by the SCI according to clause 8.4.1 of TS 38.212 [[9]](#2-References):

      - 3> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was successfully decoded for this TB or the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:

        - 4> instruct the physical layer to generate a positive acknowledgement of the data in this TB.

      - 3> else:

        - 4> instruct the physical layer to generate a negative acknowledgement of the data in this TB.

#### 5.22.2.3 Disassembly and demultiplexing

The MAC entity shall disassemble and demultiplex a MAC PDU as defined in clause 6.1.6.

## 5.23 SL-BCH data transfer

### 5.23.1 SL-BCH data transmission

When instructed to send SL-BCH, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from SBCCH;

- 1> deliver the MAC PDU to the physical layer and instruct it to generate a transmission.

### 5.23.2 SL-BCH data reception

When the MAC entity needs to receive SL-BCH, the MAC entity shall:

- 1> receive and attempt to decode the SL-BCH;

- 1> if a TB on the SL-BCH has been successfully decoded:

    - 2> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.

# 6 Protocol Data Units, formats and parameters

## 6.1 Protocol Data Units

### 6.1.1 General

A MAC PDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in length. In the figures in clause 6, bit strings are represented by tables in which the most significant bit is the leftmost bit of the first line of the table, the least significant bit is the rightmost bit on the last line of the table, and more generally the bit string is to be read from left to right and then in the reading order of the lines. The bit order of each parameter field within a MAC PDU is represented with the first and most significant bit in the leftmost bit and the last and least significant bit in the rightmost bit.

A MAC SDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in length. A MAC SDU is included into a MAC PDU from the first bit onward.

A MAC CE is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in length.

A MAC subheader is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in length. Each MAC subheader is placed immediately in front of the corresponding MAC SDU, MAC CE, or padding.

The MAC entity shall ignore the value of the Reserved bits in downlink MAC PDUs.

### 6.1.2 MAC PDU (DL-SCH and UL-SCH except transparent MAC and Random Access Response)

A MAC PDU consists of one or more MAC subPDUs. Each MAC subPDU consists of one of the following:

* A MAC subheader only (including padding);

* A MAC subheader and a MAC SDU;

* A MAC subheader and a MAC CE;

* A MAC subheader and padding.

The MAC SDUs are of variable sizes.

Each MAC subheader corresponds to either a MAC SDU, a MAC CE, or padding.

A MAC subheader except for fixed sized MAC CE, padding, and a MAC SDU containing UL CCCH consists of the header fields R/F/LCID/(eLCID)/L. A MAC subheader for fixed sized MAC CE, padding, and a MAC SDU containing UL CCCH consists of the two header fields R/LCID/(eLCID).

MAC CEs are placed together. DL MAC subPDU(s) with MAC CE(s) is placed before any MAC subPDU with MAC SDU and MAC subPDU with padding as depicted in Figure 6.1.2-4. UL MAC subPDU(s) with MAC CE(s) is placed after all the MAC subPDU(s) with MAC SDU and before the MAC subPDU with padding in the MAC PDU as depicted in Figure 6.1.2-5. The size of padding can be zero.

A maximum of one MAC PDU can be transmitted per TB per MAC entity.

### 6.1.3 MAC Control Elements (CEs)

#### 6.1.3.1 Buffer Status Report MAC CEs

Buffer Status Report (BSR) MAC CEs consist of either:

* Short BSR format (fixed size); or

* Long BSR format (variable size); or

* Short Truncated BSR format (fixed size); or

* Long Truncated BSR format (variable size).

Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE consists of:

* Pre-emptive BSR format (variable size).

The BSR formats are identified by MAC subheaders with LCIDs as specified in Table 6.2.1-2.

The Pre-emptive BSR format is identified by MAC subheaders with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2b.

The fields in the BSR MAC CE are defined as follows:

* LCG ID: The Logical Channel Group ID field identifies the group of logical channel(s) whose buffer status is being reported. The length of the field is 3 bits;

* LCGi: For the Long BSR format and Pre-emptive BSR format, this field indicates the presence of the Buffer Size field for the logical channel group i. The LCGi field set to 1 indicates that the Buffer Size field for the logical channel group I is reported. The LCGi field set to 0 indicates that the Buffer Size field for the logical channel group i is not reported. For the Long Truncated BSR format, this field indicates whether logical channel group i has data available. The LCGi field set to 1 indicates that logical channel group i has data available. The LCGi field set to 0 indicates that logical channel group i does not have data available;

* Buffer Size: The Buffer Size field identifies the total amount of data available according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [[3]](#2-References) and 38.323 [[4]](#2-References) across all logical channels of a logical channel group after the MAC PDU has been built (i.e. after the logical channel prioritization procedure, which may result the value of the Buffer Size field to zero). The amount of data is indicated in number of bytes. The size of the RLC headers and MAC subheaders are not considered in the buffer size computation. The length of this field for the Short BSR format and the Short Truncated BSR format is 5 bits. The length of this field for the Long BSR format and the Long Truncated BSR format is 8 bits. The values for the 5-bit and 8-bit Buffer Size fields are shown in Tables 6.1.3.1-1 and 6.1.3.1-2, respectively. For the Long BSR format and the Long Truncated BSR format, the Buffer Size fields are included in ascending order based on the LCGi. For the Long Truncated BSR format the number of Buffer Size fields included is maximised, while not exceeding the number of padding bits. For the Pre-emptive BSR format, the Buffer Size field identifies the total amount of the data expected to arrive at the IAB-MT of the node where the Pre-emptive BSR is triggered and does not include the volume of data currently available in the IAB-MT. Pre-emptive BSR format is identical to the Long BSR format.

NOTE 1: For the Pre-emptive BSR, if configured, the LCGs to be reported, the expected data volume calculation, the exact time to report Pre-emptive BSR and the associated LCH are left to implementation.

NOTE 2: The mapping of LCGs between the ingress and egress links of an IAB node for purposes of determining expected change in occupancy of IAB-MT buffers (to be reported as Pre-emptive BSR) is left to implementation.

NOTE 3: The number of the Buffer Size fields in the Long BSR and Long Truncated BSR format can be zero.

X is either 1 or 3 according to TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References) and TS 36.213 [[17]](#2-References).

The presence of Type 2 PH field for SpCell of the other MAC entity is configured by *phr-Type2OtherCell* with value *true*.

A single octet bitmap is used for indicating the presence of PH per Serving Cell when the highest *ServCellIndex* of Serving Cell with configured uplink is less than 8, otherwise four octets are used.

The MAC entity determines whether PH value for an activated Serving Cell is based on real transmission or a reference format by considering the configured grant(s) and downlink control information which has been received until and including the PDCCH occasion in which the first UL grant for a new transmission that can accommodate the MAC CE for PHR as a result of LCP as defined in clause 5.4.3.1 is received since a PHR has been triggered if the PHR MAC CE is reported on an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or until the first uplink symbol of PUSCH transmission minus PUSCH preparation time as defined in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [[6]](#2-References) if the PHR MAC CE is reported on a configured grant.

For a band combination in which the UE does not support dynamic power sharing, the UE may omit the octets containing Power Headroom field and PCMAX,f,c field for Serving Cells in the other MAC entity except for the PCell in the other MAC entity and the reported values of Power Headroom and PCMAX,f,c for the PCell are up to UE implementation.

#### 6.1.3.22 Guard Symbols MAC CEs

The Guard Symbols MAC CEs (i.e. Provided Guard Symbols MAC CE and Desired Guard Symbols MAC CE) are identified by the MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b for DL-SCH and in Table 6.2.1-2b for UL-SCH.

It has fixed size and consists of four octets defined as follows (Figure 6.1.3.22-1):

* R: Reserved bit, set to 0;

* Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits;

* Sub-carrier spacing (SCS): This field indicates the subcarrier spacing used as reference for the guard spacing. The length of this field is 2bits. The values for the SCS field are shown in Table 6.1.3.22-2;

* Number of Guard Symbols (NmbGSi): This field indicates the number of guard symbols for the switching scenario shown in Table 5.18.19-1. The number of guard symbols can take values within the range of 0..4. Higher values 5-7 are reserved.

#### 6.1.3.23 BFR MAC CEs

The MAC CEs for BFR consists of either:

* BFR MAC CE; or

* Truncated BFR MAC CE.

The BFR MAC CE and Truncated BFR MAC CE are identified by a MAC subheader with LCID/eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2 and Table 6.2.1-2b.

The BFR MAC CE and Truncated BFR MAC CE have a variable size. They include a bitmap and in ascending order based on the *ServCellIndex*, beam failure recovery information i.e. octets containing candidate beam availability indication (AC) for SCells indicated in the bitmap. For BFR MAC CE, a single octet bitmap is used when the highest *ServCellIndex* of this MAC entity's SCell for which beam failure is detected and the evaluation of the candidate beams according to the requirements as specified in TS 38.133 [[11]](#2-References) has been completed is less than 8, otherwise four octets are used.
